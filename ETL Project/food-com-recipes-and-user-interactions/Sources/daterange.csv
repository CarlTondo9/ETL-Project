2002372706,63786,2018-12-20,5,Finally I found a no nonsense fajita recipe
2001402443,271337,2018-12-19,3,"These took quite a long time to make and though they did turn out quite impressive looking, I found the batter kind of bland. The center, for which I used crushed Dum-Dum lollipops, was really tasty so I ended up making some into thumbprints with the lollipops spread out more. But for the amount of work I won't be making these again and that's rare for me to say as I have no problem spending time baking!"
2002371627,153647,2018-12-19,0,"Best thing about this recipe? I didn't have to scroll past a rambling stream of consciousness blog about how you were strolling past a stream whilst on a long romantic walk with your husband, spotted fish swimming, gathered wild cilantro on the way home, oh, and you're in Mexico so you bought fresh homemade corn tortillas at the market, and oh, so, yummy..... Anyways, made this tonight. Only substitution was using mayonnaise instead of eggs as binder for coating to tilapia. It was really good. Thanks for Just. Posting. A. Recipe. end rant."
2002371755,393600,2018-12-19,5,"Healthiest and tastiest by far. I do a few tweaks according to my likes. I use orange juice rather than water or apple juice, extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp vanilla and whole wheat flour. Works for me. Occasionally I top it with brown sugar. Pat it in with your hand as it soaks in nicely and makes a great crust."
2002328086,28148,2018-12-19,4,"These were good but I tweaked them to give them more flavor. I added some beans, more onion and peppers to the mix. I did use the olive oil instead of the butter. I would make again in the future."
2002024198,11763,2018-12-19,5,This a lovely simple and light lemon loaf recipe. My suggestion is to bake it in a loaf pan for best results. For my last bake I used 1 tsp of real lemon crystals from Amazon and pretty much followed the recipe as is. I did add a tsp of fake vanilla. I did not have any lemons. It is very tender and moist. I will try and make cupcakes with it the next time. I bet it would be good to make homemade Twinkies as well. I used 3% whole filtered milk.
2002371843,516662,2018-12-19,5,This cake is incredible tasting and easy to make. Frosted with 7 minute icing. Perfect for those who are gluten intolerant. Will definitely make again.
2000498330,314535,2018-12-19,5,"Delicious, brightly colored. A fun and tasty rice dish. Love"
2002178501,51803,2018-12-19,5,"Omg this was the bomb!!! Only thing i did different was soak the beans over night, rinse and tossed it in the crockpot with all other ingredients for 8 hours on low, for easy cleanup don't forget your Crock-Pot bag :)"
2002367969,149257,2018-12-19,5,"Made a double batch of this recipe. My granddaughter who is 11 and I had the most fun decorating the two houses! popcorn for chimney smoke, rock candies for walkway, ice cream cones for trees, marshmallows for snowman and chimney. Used broken pieces of jolly ranchers as the 'stained glass' for the window cutouts, pulling the cookies out of the oven 2 minutes before they were done and adding the candy pieces and cooking for 2-3 mins more until the candies were melted, then cooled the cookies. Put tea lights inside the houses so they light up and the stained glass looks awesome!"
2002372464,491512,2018-12-19,4,"Great cookies but yield is way off. I actually measured 1/2” for each slice off my measured 2” diameter logs and I ended with 28 and that was pushing it. I needed 40 cookies so I’m a little disappointed that after making my dough the day before to be prepared, I have to now go back and make the recipe again the night before my cookie swap."
2002371445,2886,2018-12-19,5,"I've been using this recipe for 2 years and its the only one i will use now(i have tried several in the past, this one is my favorite). Today i have one in the oven and i made it chock full with nuts, cranberries, chocolate chips, coconut flakes and raisens!"
2002371712,144174,2018-12-19,5,"Was really yummy, everyone loved it. I altered it a little bit by crumbling up 3 meat lover vegan beef patties from Morning Star, adding corn and omitted the fried onions and mushrooms. But it still tasted great! I also added Italian flavor seasoning and paprika along with salt and pepper."
2002371716,203755,2018-12-19,0,The chocolate lace cookie is not truly a lace cookie and would perhaps better be named Chocolate-Chocolate Chip or Double Chocolate Chip. They bear a certain after-taste and are not appealing to the eye. On the plus side they cool faster and are less breakable than a lace cookie. I make almond lace cookies all the time. They truly resemble lace and vanish from sight in no time.
2001355121,232811,2018-12-19,3,It was too acidic. I think 1tbsp vinegar would have been more than enough. 1/4 cup vinegar was too much... It's not a bad soup.... It's very simple. It's a slight upgrade from chicken broth.
2002296817,307469,2018-12-19,0,I'm telling you right now - do not toast the bun! Wrap it in a damp paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds. Perfect! Does anyone remember when they changed the Filet-o-Fish recipe and toasted the bun and added lettuce? Probably not because it was dreadful and didn't last long. Steam the bun. Please.
2002371569,263590,2018-12-19,4,I made this with a graham cracker crust and it was D-lish!!
2002371792,431399,2018-12-19,4,"These cookies taste wonderful, but 14 minutes was too long to bake. I cut the time back to 10 minutes. They came out crispy around the edges and soft and chewy in the center. The only problem was they came out completely flat. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what was the remedy?"
2002266656,64356,2018-12-18,5,I’ve been using this recipe for years and finally decided to write my review. My husband is a huge fan :) I didn’t alter the recipe at all and it is just like the restaurant. Thank you
2000123325,80156,2018-12-18,5,I just made these. I did cool the dough a bit before rolling it out. Then once I cut out the shapes and put them on cookie trays I placed them in the freezer for an hour. Baked at 375 for 7 minutes. They came out so moist and perfect and tasted great. Thanks for the recipe.
2002075532,52834,2018-12-18,5,"Quick, easy, and full of flavor. I substituted the 3 tablespoons of sugar for 2 teaspoons of stevia. Perfect balance."
10988800,366948,2018-12-18,0,"Barbecue sauce with onions, potatoes and carrots?? Gross!!"
1290903,131607,2018-12-18,5,"This is a great recipe for a nice thin crispy crust. We made a pepperoni, hot Italian sausage, red onion and jalapeno 14&quot; pizza and took your suggestion about prebaking the dough with the pizza sauce. It really came out fantastic! I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe."
2002370573,80156,2018-12-18,1,"This recipe is garbage. I made it exactly and the dough was dried and crumbly to the point where it could not be rolled. I even added water per the other recommendations. Well, that was a waste of flour and ingredients."
2002370352,367963,2018-12-18,1,"This was terrible, I guess you have to already like octopus and squid. Worse stuff I ever had."
2001563476,431399,2018-12-18,5,I saw a few so so reviews but needed a small batch so I gave these a try.....I'm so glad I did.....these cookies are great and so easy to make.....I didn't change a thing......Thanks for this great recipe....love love them....
1800292505,509363,2018-12-18,5,I made this for a crockpot social at my work. This is an inexpensive recipe. I made a quadruple order. Growing up with this dish and making it in the recent years it was always good but too salty for me. This recipe by BrairCraft was very good and I did not feel salt logged after eating a couple of servings over toast. It will be going in my recipe box. Thank you
2000482483,80409,2018-12-18,4,"Great flavors; the orzo soaked up the lemon juice and olive oil, along with the &quot;shrimp juice&quot;. The feta added another pleasant-tasting element. I doubled the amount of orzo and the shrimp. I used a foil lasagna pan. It served 4 people well."
2002370822,297154,2018-12-18,5,Best cookies I have ever made! Absolutely delicious!! Super easy to make too :)
226867,363072,2018-12-18,5,"Leaping Lizards, Lori! These are wonderful! I only had blueberries and needed to use them up which turned out to be 1 1/4 c. Whenever I make wild rice, I always make extra and freeze it for occasions just like this one! (I live in an area where wild rice is fairly easy to get and it's not crazy expensive) Anyway, the batch made 12 very generous sized muffins plus a mini loaf! Thanks for posting! (P.S. Just realized I skipped the salt and also, I should mention that I used 1 % milk with lemon juice to &quot;sour&quot; it.)"
2950250,329804,2018-12-18,5,This is the BEST chocolate syrup ever!!. It really is better than the store-bought brands. I kept tasting and tasting it. Plan to see what the grandkids think Christmas morning with their pancakes and hot chocolate. Thanks.
2002370607,80156,2018-12-18,5,These cookies are delicious. The best gingerbread cookies I’ve ever had. I made the recipe without any tweaks. It is perfect just the way it is.
2002312797,27208,2018-12-18,5,"Very tasty, I did half the seasonings because we only had about a 2 -2.5 lb elk roast for my husband and I. Very tender and juicy, I always love the veggie flavors! I loved how the drippings were already made into a gravy. Great for Sunday dinners!"
2002371044,327922,2018-12-18,5,Yummers. The only thing I'd change is adding an extra tsp. of sugar to the batter. I also add blueberries and/or bananas in the batter.
926904,457971,2018-12-18,5,"How have I never reviewed this recipe, and why aren't there more 5 star reviews? I make these every year for Christmas for the past few years, and sometimes in between, too! They're just perfect - the balance of flavors is great, and I like chewy cookies, so I don't overbake them. Plus the convenience of being able to keep the logs of dough in the freezer and slice and bake as needed is wonderful. My first batch of these this year mostly went as give-aways to various projects, so my kids were begging me to make more. You should have seen how happy my son was yesterday when I told him on the way home from the bus stop that I had finally gotten them made!"
2002361322,39577,2018-12-18,5,I have tried this recipe several times now each with different variations and it never fails. I absolutely love it the last time I made it I used chicken sausage and shrimp and it was just as tasty as the original. I also used rigatoni pasta and again it was a delight. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.
2000671813,304256,2018-12-18,5,I can't thank you enough for posting this. It had always been a favorite go to for so many recipes. I was very sad as many cooks were. One had to wonder why a company would make a decision to stop making it. I used it for my baked chicken recipe. It was a family favorite. After 15 years I prepared my chicken and wine baked chicken last night. I've searched before but never came up with your post. So happy I found it. I now have it in the&quot;Family Vault&quot;. Not sure who I'll leave it to in my will... ;)
2002218491,55679,2018-12-18,3,Followed the recipe exactly. It was sort of bland and not very flavorful. I added a sprinkle of salt which helped.
2002368192,274770,2018-12-18,5,No other sugar cookie for me ! Wonderful perfect delicious pillows I added 1 tsp baking powder since I was gana chill mine overnight .. And 1 tsp nutmeg
2002371341,491465,2018-12-18,5,"Love this recipe. I added Franks Buffalo Hot sauce to my ranch dressing marinade. Also added granulated garlic, smoked paprika, and a dash of salt &amp; ground pepper to my potatoes. Yum!"
2002367593,209317,2018-12-18,5,"I enjoy the sauce, but cannot figure how they settled on the hour cook time. In my experience, just braising until the internal temperature hits 135-140 (more like 15-20 minutes) and then wrapping the pork in foil to let the carryover finish the meat while the sauce reduces always results in perfectly tender, juicy chops."
2002289365,474245,2018-12-18,4,"Really impressed with the flavour - similar to those pillsbury cookie dough you find in the stores. Not dairy free myself, but my nieces are and made these for us to decorate. Came out great. However, I will say that the dough was SUPER crumbly and hard to roll out after leaving in the fridge. I am thinking it would be easier to roll directly after making as once it softened up a bit it was easier. Baked 375 for 10 minutes in my oven. Made approx 40 cookies (some small, some medium)."
2002371420,50245,2018-12-18,5,"Made this with a slight variation. Added the parmesan cheese to the flour. Dipped chicken in egg, then flour/cheese mixture. Very tender. After liquids cooked, I added chicken back to pan with liquid and simmered for 5 mins while waiting for pasta to cook."
2002370648,356948,2018-12-18,3,THe shortbread smells good... But when baking theres alot of cracks and while rolling the dough keeps on sticking on the rooling pin
2002370541,160174,2018-12-18,3,"I wish that you would had written in your instructions on how to incorporate the Kalua. I had melted 48 oz. chocolate chips and the product was perfect! Not knowing, I added the Kalua and it seized the chocolate. I ended up with plates of pretzels, marshmallows, fresh fruit and no fountain. Please, please add the instructions."
2001926746,125055,2018-12-18,5,I would split the recipe in half. They make a lot. I gave many of them to family and friends They were a hit! Many thought they tasted like 'shoo fly pie'. I will be making these again and again.
2002370424,228102,2018-12-18,5,"Great, easy recipe. Meat was very tender and shredded easily. Yummy flavor. Not too spicy...just right.. We sauted peppers and onion, made Spanish rice and served it as fajitas. Definitely a hit!"
2002371157,18157,2018-12-18,5,Thank you so much for this. I'm always searching for low sodium alternatives. Used this in a slow cooker chicken recipe and it turned out great. So easy - very happy to have this on hand.
2002370666,13598,2018-12-18,0,i love this recipes make it easy for everyone this is winner thanks for sharing. https://shahidmalik9678.blogspot.com/2018/11/Unique-kheer-dishes-2018.html
334014,3655,2018-12-17,5,"I am a soup lover, and this is one of my favorites. I got this exact recipe from a friend 30+ years ago, and it has remained one of our top 5, all-time faves. It is a little more work than most, since you have to make the meatballs. As a young mom, to save time, I once just threw all the meatball ingredients into the pot instead of making the meatballs, and it was still delicious (but I like it better with them). It's a keeper. Thanks for posting!"
2002369279,105889,2018-12-17,5,"Love the original from lambs. Here's how i tweak this recipe. I use all dark brown sugar, dark corn syrup and most importantly, lightly roast pecans before adding"
2002370179,502353,2018-12-17,5,"Fantastic bread. This is probably my favorite recipe so far. I did make two modifications however. Instead of 3 cups of all-purpose flour I used 1 cup each of rye, wheat, and bread flours. I also added one egg. It was fabulous!"
2002369480,14561,2018-12-17,0,I’ve been baking for 60 years. Made this for my grandsons birthday. Followed your directions to the letter. It was a disaster. When we cut into lt after it was refrigerated overnight it wasn’t close to done the inside had the consistency of pudding. Nowhere in the recipe do you tell how to determine if it’s done. Such a waste of time and money.
2002369442,104975,2018-12-17,2,"I hate to leave such a negative review after so many positive ones, but these just did not work out for me. I used just milk and dark chocolate Hershey kisses &amp; had no problem with the initial preparation of baking, melting, and squishing down the kisses with an M&amp;M. I ran into a huge problem when I removed these from the freezer. When I placed these in a baggie for storage, all of the kisses detached from the pretzels. Now, I didn’t forcibly toss them into the bag, but I didn’t delicately place them in there either. I simply removed them from the tray and put them into a Ziploc bag for storage and they all came apart. I had to place them back into the oven to remelt and squish down again. I left them out to resolidify and that seems to work well, but it was a giant waste of time to have to redo everything. My plan was to make a ton of these to bag up and give to coworkers for the holidays, but I am afraid they will all end up with a bag of “naked” pretzels and M&amp;Ms Hershey kisses. I guess it will just seem like festive trail mix, but that’s not what I was going for, and not what this recipe was supposed to do."
2001513060,367414,2018-12-17,1,"maybe I did something wrong , but I thought they tasted horrible and nothing like any caramels I have ever had"
2001821103,98867,2018-12-17,5,This bread was easy to make and tasted delicious. The only thing I did different from the recipe was I soaked the raisins in some dark rum and sugar and I added 1/2 cup more raisins. I liked that the recipe included the temperature of the milk and the water. Very important component to the recipe which most people leave out. So thank you for a great recipe!
2001467041,19023,2018-12-17,5,"My son started his high school wrestling season and had to adjust his diet to make weight. Therefore, he's eating almost exclusively meals made with a combination of chicken breasts, brown rice, broccoli, green bean and snap peas. I wanted to make him a BBQ sauce to flavor the chicken. I'm so grateful to Dana-MMH for posting her finger lickin- good BBQ sauce because it is DIVINE! This yielded about 24 ounces of sauce and I wanted to store it in a mason jar. Well, that left about 4 ounces extra. I could not stop spooning it into my mouth! It has a perfect balance of sweetness, vinegar, heat and savoriness."
2002369511,80156,2018-12-17,5,"I've always been afraid to try making gingerbread men. Between rolling and cutting the cookies and finding a recipe where the cut outs wouldn't spread and look like gingerbread blobs, there were just too many ways to fail. So for years I just didn't try. But I love gingerbread. A lot. No really, a LOT. So I looked at about fifty different recipes (no exaggeration) and ultimately decided to try this one. I am SO glad I did. The dough was easy to put together. Foolproof even. It was easy to roll out and the cookies didn't spread when cooked. These will, without a doubt end up in my regular Christmas rotation!"
2002025577,173518,2018-12-17,5,This is the best coffee cake I've made in a long time. It was easy to put together and not too crumbly that I couldn't slice it.
2002369550,80156,2018-12-17,4,"Let me start by saying my spices were not super fresh, so that could be my problem. These rolled out beautifully smooth, baked nicely, and are perfect for icing. But I followed the recipe exactly and they came out so bland! It tasted like plain banana bread for some reason. (My husband will love that.) I used regular molasses as another user suggested. What could be my problem here? Did anyone add to the amount of spices in this recipe? I like strong flavors and I’m just not getting it. UPDATE: the next day they tasted better, and the texture is AMAZING. I’ll try again with fresh spices. I’m a believer."
527509,78552,2018-12-17,2,"This cake did not bake properly. It was burnt on the outside and raw in the middle. I had to turn the oven off and leave the cake in there... It had barely sent... 350 is way too hot. Even 325 is way too hot. I would recommend 300... In the end it tasted good enough, but I think it could have used a bit more extract.( BTW, If you decide to use mini loaf pans, I recommend 325 for 50 minutes.) I really wanted to give this recipe five stars, but with such an incorrect baking temperature and time I don't think I can. Eventually, I'll try and make this again... But I'll be baking us at 300 next time. I'll see what happens in posting update! I really really wanted to like this. Maybe next time it'll be better."
2002369650,468382,2018-12-17,2,Doesn't tell you how much water to use. It doesn't make donut holes... It makes funnel cake.
2002369373,472402,2018-12-17,5,"I haven't had this for over 30 years, the last time when I lived in Minnesota in an area with many people of German descent. It tasted just like I remembered. Thank you!"
2002369789,215974,2018-12-17,5,"These scones are the diddly darn BEST scones I have ever tasted in all my 62 years of bein alive on this wonderful earth! My Mexican husband said they were &quot;deliciouso! whatever that means&quot; If I could give more stars, I would. ;)"
2002369395,112647,2018-12-17,1,My husband says it tastes like a sock!
2002370317,69990,2018-12-17,5,"This is a pretty good recipe. Though not a knock on the finished product, the amounts are overkill. I have successfully used the basic recipe for three pounds of chicken tenders. BTW, make sure the tenders are at room temperature as cold from the fridge congeals the butter quick. And this exact recipe is on several websites."
2002369315,74608,2018-12-17,5,"This was my first time trying to make Gingerbread Cookies and they came out wonderful. The coloring, flavor and texture were perfect. I followed you instructions completely except I used the plastic wrap when I was rolling out the dough before cutting. That prevents any sticky to the rolling pin. Of course you have to work fast, as you stated or it just gets soft and sticky to cut. Thank you! I hope my child’s class enjoys them."
2002369261,4478,2018-12-17,0,Eihave made a similar recipe previously and found this very confusing. It is really important to specify whether temps. Are Celsius or Fahrenheit. The whole thing is ruined if you use 250 F to dry it out!!
2002370136,397552,2018-12-17,0,"Oh, my. Polish myself. There is NO mushroom soup in Golumpkis!"
117501,529600,2018-12-17,5,This is our go-to recipe for soft chocolate chip cookies. They turn out perfect every time. Thanks for posting.
1271506,53121,2018-12-17,5,"Saw Sara Moulton cook this on her show with the suggestion that they be used as holiday gifts. I just &quot;field tested&quot; the recipe and will definitely be taking her advice; what an interesting, sophisticated snack!"
2002369856,114514,2018-12-17,5,"I don't often review recipes, but I have to say, this is an AWESOME recipe! My husband and I LOVED this, and we really aren't big black eyed pea fans. I made it to take for a covered dish to a Christmas party. The flavor is wonderful. Only changes were, I used frozen black eyed peas. I cut the bacon into pieces before I saut&eacute;ed it in the Instant Pot, then I added the rest of the ingredients (added more garlic cause there can never be too much garlic in anything). Then set the IP to the soup setting, which cooked it for 10 minutes. Then I got busy and left it in there for 20-30 minutes on natural release. The peas were tender and the soup is flavorful! I recommend this recipe."
2002359509,537351,2018-12-17,0,"Made this today. It was delicious! I recommend using only one packet of the onion soup mix, well distributed over the chicken. There should still be plenty of flavor."
2001513060,192495,2018-12-17,5,This is a keeper. Delicious Soup that both my hubby and I loved. I look forward to making it again.
2002370192,263707,2018-12-17,0,"I had this magazine for many years and lost it in one of my moves. I have searching the internet for as long as I can remember and was never able to locate the exact recipe. knew most of the ingredients so I could tell the ones I found were not the right one. This year, I searched again and lo and behold, I finally found it I used a Mikasa Parklane Crystal glass bottom which leaves a star shaped indentation. The sugar crystals fall into the grooves so the cookies look like snow, stars or Christmas ornaments. I adore this recipe so much. My kids always know I would make these and have always related Christmas to me making these cookies. I feel like it's my own recipe, though I know it's not. Thank you for sharing this recipe !! Feeling Grateful &amp; Blessed !!"
454804,20713,2018-12-17,0,"Made this as gifts. Did 6, quart jars plus had enough left over to fill the Nesquick canister full. Finely ground up some candy canes and mixed in . Layered the jars with chocolate chips, broken candy canes and marshmallows. Printed some mixing instructions and glued to the back of the Christmas tag. Upped the cocoa powder and did 2 regular boxes of pudding."
10433937,219828,2018-12-17,0,"I love chocolate martinis. When I was at a friends wedding years ago in La Jolla, CA I had the best martini ever and this is what took it over the top. The bartender pulled out a little tub of chocolate ganache and slathered it around the rim of the glass. It was so good, no messy dripping chocolate around rims. I've had one before that the chocolate ran inside and outside the glass. Try this method of a chocolate rim and you will never go back to syrup drizzle."
400708,5123,2018-12-17,5,"I was shocked at the amount of Baking Powder, but went with it and so glad. Made just as directed and they come perfect. Light, airy and such a wonderful flavor of almonds and lemon. I've never made these before but they are going on my cookie must make from now on. Thanks so much for posting."
2002369939,528696,2018-12-17,0,"Very good recipe. I used Trader Joes corn medley and added a little fresh sweet bell pepper , but it was great."
2002368412,257924,2018-12-16,5,Very good. Used lard and turned out good.will make again.
1924549,184356,2018-12-16,5,These are a favorite with friends that I give Christmas cookies to and are requested each year. They spread out quite a bit and don't look successful but have a nice balance of crunchy and chewy.
2002367966,288125,2018-12-16,5,I followed the recipe (using bread flour) to the T and was rewarded with fabulous pasta. Thank you for the detailed instructions. Very encouraging for a first time pasta roller!
2002369208,30965,2018-12-16,4,"These were so tasty! I skipped the rolling them into balls part, though and just dropped by the spoonful into my simmering broth. I think this kept them from being too dense, as some users are complaining of."
2002368159,269925,2018-12-16,5,these cookies are amazing! i followed this exact recipe when i made them and they were so chewy and so soft. everyone who has tasted them has asked me if i can make them again. 10/10!
2216466,132194,2018-12-16,4,I found the cookie dough to be a bit dry. I added an egg and a full jar (16.3 oz) of creamy peanut butter.
2002159532,50245,2018-12-16,5,"Very good. Made this for a party of 25 people... Made ahead and just reheated (covered) in the oven. Added sliced lonins between layers of chicken and it looked beautiful. Tasted great. I did cut the butter to about half, still wonderful flavor. Will make again for company and family dinner!"
2002368926,118242,2018-12-16,5,Easy to make and looking forward to sharing the brownies with my team at work!
448342,332410,2018-12-16,4,Made this last night for a dinner party. Everyone seemed to like them and one person requested the recipe. I wanted to use the flaky dough sheet listed on the recipe but was unable to find it at our local grocery. I chose to use a pie crust. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
1628152,340812,2018-12-16,5,"This is a keeper! Thank you for sharing. I used the Pillsbury Best GF blend (which already has Xanthan Gum), maple syrup instead of honey (because we have a ton of maple syrup) and Crisco instead of butter or margarine since we're allergic to both. They came out fantastic, despite my wobbly scoring. Now I can make smore's and graham cracker crusts!"
2001886735,19678,2018-12-16,0,"I made this, but only used one tablespoon of sugar with a dash of stevia for sweetness. We poured it over a banana split, and my kids loved it!"
2002369137,372087,2018-12-16,0,I feel like Paula Deen made this recipe.
2002243128,331217,2018-12-16,5,"Really good, I used plain honey and butter, turned out a little burnt but I think if I just cut 5ish minutes off the cooking time it would have been perfect. Tasted great, I made it yesterday afternoon and as of bedtime today there are only three slices left."
2000718194,94271,2018-12-16,5,"Great bread. Saving this recipe, as this is a new family favorite! Thank you!"
2001997532,129926,2018-12-16,5,These enchiladas are amazing! Have made several times and have tweaked by using rotisserie chicken to save time and it adds a tremendous amount of flavor! Best sour cream enchiladas ever! Get so many compliments!
2002368179,371510,2018-12-16,1,Worse recipe I have ever done! Should have added milk only as needed after flavorings. Goopy gloppy a child could have done better and these are supposed to go to people for the Holidays - hopefully it will set and not make the cookies soggy. I am really irked with the results and I won't be accessing recipes on this website again.
282673,330437,2018-12-16,5,"I have made this at Christmas for several years now. If you are looking for a people-pleaser, this is it! I am not as wild about it myself, but others LOVE it. I always take some to work. Last year, one of my coworkers asked me to make a loaf that he could take home. It didn't happen last year, but I surprised him with one this year. He was on the verge of tears of joy. Later my boss came up to me with a slice in his hand, saying, &quot;This is SOO good! What am I eating?&quot; It really provokes that strong of reactions. A universal fave amongst my recipients."
218535,83524,2018-12-16,3,Only ok. We did not like the taste of the butter
2000498330,118122,2018-12-16,5,"Lovely bread. Soft texture, high rising. I added the apples with the other ingredients and turned out fine. Too busy to wait for the beep. Very happy."
2002366660,106641,2018-12-16,1,"This recipe didn't work for me at all. Followed it to the letter (two attempts), and the mixture ended up separating and I couldn't get it to reincorporate. Had to throw both batches out. ?? I'm at high altitude, so don't know if that made a difference."
2002368038,473466,2018-12-16,0,"The pie is still in the oven so I can't yet say how it tastes, however, the recipe made enough filling for two pies. I used an electric mixer to blend the juice/cream cheese/condensed milk/egg yolks because a whisk would've had a hard time incorporating the cream cheese. Maybe this created extra fluff, I don't know. But anyway, if anyone else is going to take such a step as I, make two pie shells for sure. Also, mine puffed up considerably in the oven, so take care when filling the pie shell."
2002368940,395966,2018-12-16,5,"I used my bread machine set on dough setting. Then shaped in sandwhich roll form, and sprinkled everything bagel topping after rise, baked on 375 for 25 minutes. My whole house smelled like subway making their bread. Taste great. Love this recipe."
2002368262,63071,2018-12-16,0,"Lovely recipe. I tweaked it milk wise,had some real cream leftover and whole milk mix. Mmmm yummy! Added lightly chopped blueberries, Excellent!"
218535,108068,2018-12-16,5,I did not put the cheese slices on top. Still good.
2002368345,80156,2018-12-16,5,"This recipe is perfect! I have made it both with lemon zest and without and they are delicious both ways. The MOST important instructions is to let it rest for the two to eight hours. The longer the better. There is no other adjustment required if you follow the measurements precisely. These will disappear quicker than you can decorate them,"
2002368953,254395,2018-12-16,5,"I used this recipe yesterday; and it was my first time ever attempting to make cheese filled pierogi. I was raised on Leniwe as our holiday tradition. These turned out to be absolutely perfect! After reading the reviews, I followed the advice of adding water to dough to get it to the right consistency after mixing it all together. Everything that followed was easy. Rolling, filling, pressing the edges together (sometimes I saw that they were coming apart before I put into water so I just pressed harder or wet the edge with my finger to get them to stay). Each one turned out beautiful. I was so excited about this recipe; I shared with my mom (she's 84) and she's going to make them too!"
2002367998,243008,2018-12-16,5,"Wow, this was incredible. I used pork andouille sausage and added a generous amount of cayenne pepper since we like spicy food and it was fantastic."
2002368192,201364,2018-12-16,5,"Frosting dreams come true ! I Doubled , ((I always use salted butter)) using a 7.5 cup bag of powdered sugar At least 1/2 cup whipping cream plus a splash 3 tsp high quality vanilla And 1/4 teaspoon almond ext, just enough Not to notice it - but pairs excellent if you use just a tiny bit I am amazed - this is the perfect cookie frosting perfect anything frosting this is - the oh my god wedding cake frosting Die and go to heaven I’ll just have a spoon of that You can absolutely use milk , whole is always better but the ratio / of sugar butter flavor is just the best"
2000058449,116269,2018-12-16,5,"The first time I made these, I didn't have ketjap manis, so used soy sauce mixed with a little brown sugar (after reading what ketjap manis was supposed to taste like). This added a sweetness that plain soy sauce doesn't give and adds a whole new dimension to the flavor. I've made them several times since, sometimes just with soy sauce, but our favorite way is with the soy/brown sugar mixture. They're delicious either way and they freeze so perfectly, I make extras every time and toss a few bags in the deep freeze for a quick, easy meal when we need it. Thanks for an amazing, easy and delicious recipe!!"
218535,14814,2018-12-16,5,Good use of leftover ham.
218535,242547,2018-12-16,5,amazing. one of the best crockpot bbq recipes
2002368117,349246,2018-12-16,1,"Awful. The texture of the batter was odd and the only thing I could taste was flour. And might I add, I added 2 teaspoons of flour. Another thing, the batter did not rise at all. Never trying again, would not recommend."
2000567739,149257,2018-12-16,5,I love this recipe! The first time I tried this recipe it was the first time I ever made gingerbread or a gingerbread house. The dough was super easy to make and work with. I had to convert the recipe into a gluten free one and it was just perfect. The spices are spot on. This is the best tasting gingerbread I ever had. I have used this recipe three times and each time it came out great and was easy to work with. Everyone who tried the cookies or house said that it was the best gingerbread they have had. I made it exactly as written except for substuting butter for margarine and gluten free flour blend with xanthan gum for the flour. Won’t bother trying any other recipe. This is my go to recipe forever. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!
2002093000,56804,2018-12-16,5,"What a great idea, you had me @ blue bayou where I had my first Monte Cristo (&amp; fell in love with) decades ago! This was tasty &amp; will be making again. Actually it's dinner tonight!"
2001309141,423478,2018-12-16,5,"Wonderfull recipe wich I have been making with pleasure. Most of times I substitute the sugar and use honey, even for the walnuts and cinnamon. It makes a delicious flavor and it smells all over the appartment. First time I bought a natural apple juice, but since the second time I use apple and a mixer to make the apple juice, which makes the cake more soft. Delicious, I do not use sugar or any top, the cake for itself is one of the best cakes which i have eaten."
2002368308,25745,2018-12-16,5,This was awesome...I left the beer out and added carrots...corn bread was also a nice addition...
2002367957,24297,2018-12-16,5,I made this for my family and they fell in love. We love spedini but this is even better!!
146742,278872,2018-12-16,5,It is a great appetizer for any occasion at home or to take to a gathering. This is already a favorite.
2001169689,221178,2018-12-16,5,"They puffed up very nicely. I substituted 1/4 c of powdered sugar, chilled two hours before rolling in sugar and baking. Deb says very cake like. I like too."
2002151445,446449,2018-12-16,5,"Very good! I followed the recipe, however I used just a few less noodles as I prefer lots of sauce (and I’m only cooking for two), and I omitted the peas simply because I don’t like them. Loved it, perfect amount of spice!"
2002368255,434121,2018-12-16,0,As noted elsewhere in the reviews the ration of bread crumbs to ground meat is WAY off in this recipe. 1/2 cup crumbs per pound of meat is a lot better. I'm neither here nor there regarding dredging the meatballs in flour before browning. I'd never seen it done before so I tried it. Meh. It added nothing but an apparently useless step. I love Lydia-have cooked lots of her recipes but this one? Not so much. For years I've made meatballs following the recipe in my old Fannie Farmer cookbook and they are far better than this recipe...that recipe calls for all ground beef and I've always used half beef and half pork but it's still a better recipe than this one.
2002037959,246744,2018-12-16,5,"I made the dough for this in my bread machine. It turned out great. Instead of making rolls I used half for a pizza dough. Skipped the second ride, preheated my iron skillet in the convection oven at 450 setting (actually it's 425, though, the oven adjusts itself). Brushed the dough with olive oil, cooked for 5 minutes, topped and cooked for another 15 minutes. The PERFECT PIZZA CRUST! With the other half of the dough I let it rise for another 40 minutes then cooked as a bread at 375. I will be using this recipe all the time!"
218535,167834,2018-12-16,5,so delicious that it's gone in the blink of an eye
2002366883,273460,2018-12-15,0,"We don't eat this recipe in Mexico. It's true chile ancho is common in some dishes like mole, adobo, pipian (all of them are different sauces to cook meat). Cod is commonly cooked in Vizcaina or Veracruzna style in Christmas: onion, garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, herbs, olives, capers, &quot;chiles largos&quot; (long, thin and green pale chile, not spicy) and sometimes little potatoes."
2002102502,537543,2018-12-15,0,I Didn't see pumpkin puree in ingredients just applesauce but it is listed in directions. Can you please verify for me as I love ginger loaf. Thank you and best regards! Happy Christmas! Laura Finch
2002366845,153642,2018-12-15,0,"I only had 2 bananas so I added cinnamon applesauce and the muffins were delicious. I usually don't care much for banana bread but the combo of bananas, applesauce, and blueberries made these muffins delightful."
2002367588,80156,2018-12-15,5,"This is a great recipe, people who have bad comments on it obviously screwed it up. If you follow the instructions carefully and double check measurements you will have no problems. The dough will look dry af when you work it together. If you keep stiring and pressing the dough down it will eventually combine. If it's still too dry you've obviously added too much flour. The measurements are pretty precise. What I tried was keep rotating and condensing the pieces together in a bowl until it is combined and uniform with care not to actually knead it. Let it sit for an hour or two to &quot;soak&quot; up the ingredients and you will be fine. Note, USE FANCY OR ORIGINAL UNSULPHERED MOLASSES. Blackstrap molasses are bitter and not as sweet. It will ruin your cookies!!! This is a fairly spicy cookie, you can tone it down by adding a bit less of each spice. I added an extra 2 Tbsp of butter to jazz it up a bit and a bit less baking soda/baking powder so it doesn't spread as much as I was trying retain the shape I cut out! Good luck!"
2002366813,80156,2018-12-15,0,"I made an account just so I could tell you that this has been my signature recipe for over 4 years now. I have gotten so many compliments and people asking for my recipe(I always tell them to come find this page) and I have used this in both Christmas cookie extravaganzas where I double the recipe and have enough for an army, and also school projects where I had to create a diagram so I made it out of gingerbread. This is the BEST. Love the spiciness and the softness."
65957,57589,2018-12-15,5,"Very yummy, a party hit at Thanksgiving. And gluten free too :)"
2001161575,237136,2018-12-15,5,Mmmm. Yummy. We always bake 450 f for 30 min. Juicy! My hubby even loves it and he is picky. Served with mashed garlic potatoes and zucchini.
1801795884,525061,2018-12-15,5,A simple and easy recipe for the coconut lovers such as myself. I drizzled a tiny bit of chocolate over each one as I was bringing them to a baptism brunch and wanted to jazz them up a little bit. Thanks Bonnie~
955455,2496,2018-12-15,5,"&quot;Would you please make your yummy chocolate cake?&quot; I always explain that it isn't mine, but thanks for &quot;my chocolate&quot; cake that works every time. Sometimes I add coffee granules to the hot water for a Mocha version."
2853327,316205,2018-12-15,5,I've made these before and they're very good but I thought I could make them even better. Two notes: (1) the breadcrumb/butter topping called for in this recipe is way too much - I had gobs left over the first time. (2) It's not clear in the recipe but you don't use the stems and gills. I cut the amount of butter &amp; breadcrumbs by 3/4 but kept the herbs and spices per instructions and added 1 tsp. lemon zest. These were fabulous!
2000037510,177130,2018-12-15,5,I've made these potatoes for years and they are awesome! Someone substituted red potatoes for russets saying the recipe took longer. Red potatoes cook faster than russets. They have a different texture making them creamy. I accidentally bought smoked Gruyere and it is amazing as well!
40387940,266529,2018-12-15,5,This is a wonderful tasting icing and is very shiny when it dries. Mine didn't completely dry hard like royal icing so it was much easier to eat. I brought cookies to a party and people went nuts over them. I did add the almond extract but omitted the vanilla as I wanted the cookies pure white.
2001564498,504768,2018-12-15,3,Lanttulaatikko = rutabaga casserole. The recipe is correct apart from the turnips. Turnip is more bitter than rutabaga. I would recommend using rutabagas instead.
2002367132,400773,2018-12-15,5,"Excellent. Not just true to the original, but one of the greatest vegetable soups ever made. Bravo."
2000697206,28467,2018-12-15,5,"A different recipe in every cafe in New Mexico, and they're all good. However, I encountered this very recipe (or near enough) in a little place in Chama N.M. and it was so good it brought tears of joy to my eyes. Here in Alaska we just don't get Hatch chiles so I use canned diced peppers, and no matter the size of the batch I make, it goes within 2 days."
2001920974,88728,2018-12-15,0,"I am excited to try these. My mom used to make apricot pastries as a Christmas Cookie. I can't find the recipe in her cookbooks, so I am hoping this is it, or at least close enough. My dad said she made a yeast dough, not a cream cheese based dough, for the cookies. I remember her cooking the apricot on the stove with water and a bit of sugar. We lost her six years ago, so I can't just ask her :( Is there a cultural heritage to your cookies? My parents are first generation European immigrants from the WW2 migration. Thanks for sharing!"
2002326807,537671,2018-12-15,0,"These are an absolute work of art, but just too tedious and time consuming for my time in life. Hooray and best wishes to those who endeavor to do them. Again luxeandthelady THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!"
2001297534,245912,2018-12-15,5,I made this recipe as written. It was easy to put together and delicious. Thanks for sharing.
2002366687,80963,2018-12-15,0,"I halved this recipe, but kept the honey and oil (I used extra virgin olive oil) measurements as is and it turned out very well. I also used unsweetened almond milk and a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed and 2 1/2 tbsp water)."
2938508,59462,2018-12-15,2,This recipe is NOTHING like the real thing which tastes like great bread. This is doughy and not at all buttery like the real pretzels. I followed directions exactly but unimpressed and will search for another recipe. This was a waste of time.
2002365848,44904,2018-12-14,4,"This was the first time making these steaks. I used amino acid instead of soy sauce. Had to water it to taste as it was quite strong, but very good recipe. Turned out just like the picture. We enjoy our steaks just a little bit more cooked, not too raw so cooked a minute more each side, but steaks were almost 1.5 inches thick.. Definitely do not cook too long as tuna will turn hard and or too well done after it sits for awhile. Loved the flavor. Also, I used Chritospher’s Ranch garlic/ginger paste instead of garlic and ginger amounts. Used it to our taste after blending the rest of the ingredients together. Marinated it over night. Was sooooo good! Saved recipe to personal file. Num!"
2002068736,37861,2018-12-14,5,What a wonderful little muffin to have on hand at the Christmas season. Perfect for that little snack or addition to your breakfast meal. The only substitution I used was coconut sugar versus white sugar. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. Sincerely. Denise
2002366294,20376,2018-12-14,5,"Absolutely 5 stars! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out beautiful! Some reviewers mentioned how hard it was to get them off the pan, so I used parchment paper. Easy fix! Loved them!"
2002366607,485215,2018-12-14,5,"I wrote this down years ago off the back of the bag, and I'm so glad I found it for this year! I've gotten compliments every single year on these cookies....I've made these plain with just a little sugar sprinkled on and also gone full out and decorated them elaborately with royal icing, etc. They hold up spectacularly either way. Perfect sweetness, density, and crumb, this is literally THE BEST sugar cookie recipe EVER. (Even better than my grandma's...I said it!) I love seeing the look on people's face when they ask for the recipe and I tell them where I got it....priceless!"
305531,27971,2018-12-14,5,"Total yum. I only made a few of these for myself while watching football. Good thing I only made a few.........I would have eaten them all otherwise. Thanks, Bev, for sharing a great keeper."
1800120288,50782,2018-12-14,5,Good and easy. You wouldn't think cream cheese would add that much to scrambled eggs but it really does. I also used buttermilk since I had it to use up.
2002365341,266529,2018-12-14,1,"Requires an addl 1 1/4 teaspoon milk and 1+teaspoon corn syrup. And with those additions, it only made enough icing for 22 sugar cookies. Not a good recipe. And if using for 'white' icing, need to use clear vanilla. I guess that would be a given for a seasoned baker, which I am not."
2617226,29351,2018-12-14,5,Wow....I was really impressed. This was the first time making this soup and It tasted as good as the one I get from the Thai restaurant. This is a must try for those who like Tom Yum soup.
1803509749,80156,2018-12-14,0,"I've been using this recipe for many years, there is no better. I like my cookies thinner so I roll the dough out 1/8 instead of 1/4 in. Great with royal icing. However, 1/4 thickness is perfect for my traditional Christmas Surfer Hawaiian gingerbread house;) complete with palm trees and surf boards. I'm trying to work a pattern out for a CA Christmas lifeguard stand for this year. Let me know if anyone knows a good pattern."
2002361699,80156,2018-12-14,0,This is the best gingerbread recipe ever great for cookies good for structure for gingerbread houses and the flavor is amazing make it make it make it thank you so much!!!!
2002366577,149257,2018-12-14,5,I really like this recipe! I've been making it for years! Thank you for sharing it!
2002366476,446936,2018-12-14,5,"Wow, there is a reason these cookies won an award! Delicious. Moist chewy fudgy and I used Red Current jelly!"
675308,83008,2018-12-14,5,This was FANTASTIC. Even my picky husband loved it. I used 2 big smoked ham hocks and a small &quot;slab&quot; of salt pork (don't let the name fool you... salt 0ork is not salty). I used my hand-held immersion blender to blend it in the crockpot. I froze half of it.
2002215295,94907,2018-12-14,5,"Very tasty! I added a tweak, but these have quickly become a family favorite!"
2002365857,2886,2018-12-14,5,"Best banana bread recipe I have ever made, and I have been through many! None of mine ever seem to turn out, but this one does every time."
49542,88503,2018-12-14,5,"Great satisfaction for my pancake craving. Easy, delicious and, yes, eggy. But that's a good thing for me. Will make again."
2002366558,2886,2018-12-14,5,"Funny, &quot;Remove odd pots and pans from oven.&quot;"
2002366073,141479,2018-12-14,0,"I made this 3 times, and all 3 times the fudge did not set up. It was very sticky. Why is it doing this?"
2002366641,19666,2018-12-14,5,Fantastic! I marinated the wings in the fridge first for an hour. Then I lined two Pyrex 9x13 glass dishes with tin foil and put the wing in the pans. I had 4lbs of wings. I baked the wings for 30mins on 350 turning and basting them then I turned the oven up to 375 for 20 minutes and then up to 400 for 20 more minutes. They turned out perfect. They did not burn and the sauce thickened beautifully!
2002328394,363102,2018-12-14,5,"I made this tonight (12/13/18). I'm used to meat sauce or creamy sauce on pasta, so was a little concerned with the broth being so light. I didn't use olives, nor garlic. I also added a large piece of chicken cooked on the stove in olive oil and chopped it up. I'm not one to measure things and I didn't this time either. Added a little more of this and a little more of that. A little extra seasoning, too. My husband and I both thought this was really good. And it was so easy to put together. Will be making this often now."
2000948291,55335,2018-12-14,2,"These cookies are horrible. I mean seriously. They are cakey, and so totally too soft to stack and/or move around at all and taste heavily like baking soda and baking powder. Ish. Seriously. Totally disappointed in these. On to the next cuz this one is NOT it. 100%"
2002055358,234696,2018-12-14,1,I was extremely disappointed in this recipe. Too much cream cheese and not enough shrimp. It needed more seasonings.
2002365794,128813,2018-12-14,3,"Super creative recipe and I thought the flavors would be a nice combo. But this just wasn't it. Glad you shared, not a big fan personally."
2002330086,25885,2018-12-14,5,"I too added vanilla, cinnamon, and baking powder. Very moist and delish!!"
2002365822,95632,2018-12-14,5,"This came out great! I used a combo of apple cider vinegar and white vinegar, red and yellow bell pepper, jalape&ntilde;os, serrano peppers and habanero peppers. I emulsified the mixture during cooking leaving just a few chucks for color and used 2 packages of liquid pectin because I didn't want a runny jelly. It came out perfect. Make sure to skim off any foam too so you get a good clear jelly without foamy chunks floating around."
2002365800,372087,2018-12-14,1,I followed directions (in retrospect I should have read the reviews first). I do not have cookie batter. Even after adding extra flour I have soup. Soup that is separating. I have no idea how to fix it so I've just thrown expensive soup in the trash. Thanks for an awful recipe.
2002366072,278346,2018-12-14,5,"I first saw this recipe in a magazine, The Taste of Home” or “The Taste of Country”, not sure which. This soup is absolutely fabulous. I have made it every year for at least 20 years on the day after Christmas, and it is such a hit that December 26th is known in my house as “Sauerkraut Soup” Day. My husband has some Czech roots so it really speaks to him! As with so many soups, this one gets better and better as the days go by so I make it 2-3 days ahead. Hearty, soul-satisfying, and it cuts through all the rich food you’ve eaten over the holidays. It’s one of those perfect soups for chilly weather, anytime! A dollop of sour cream on top and good rye bread on the side and I’m a very happy camper! Love it."
2001441005,162864,2018-12-14,5,"Great recipe except for the salt with over 2,000 mg per serving, that is over the daily recommend amount. Also, being Vegan I tweak it a little. Used 8oz of a vegan sausage substitute, and home made veggie broth (no salt), can tomatoes no salt. I used both dried and fresh herbs. With those changes I came up with 7 servings, 383 calories per serving, ands 375 mg of sodium. It has a good amount of protein @ 29 grams. Thanks for the recipe!"
2002365044,50763,2018-12-13,5,"Thanks for this ORIGINAL OAMC recipe! I started making this when my kids were in elementary school. I always followed this recipe precisely, but made a quadruple batch to freeze for future meals. I lost the cookbook long ago, but my 26 year old, who is now gluten free, is requesting this for dinner tonight. Making rice too so we can do a bowl of chili and rice or burrito style... Thanks for posting this!"
2001455874,311584,2018-12-13,5,Excellent quick dinner. I didn't have flour so I used Italian bread crumbs!
2002365514,169689,2018-12-13,0,i just made pickled eggplant some recipes say to not refrigerate until opened you say refrigerate them they are in oil can you tell me which is right
2002364987,66703,2018-12-13,5,"Excellent recipe ! I make this one all the time and everyone is obsessed with them, even those who really don’t like peanut butter that much ! ??"
2001787348,134725,2018-12-13,5,"I was very skeptical when I saw the ingredients for the marinade, but surprisingly this works. I marinated first time for the hour it said but the chicken had no flavor. let it marinate until my next day off, which was 3 days later, and the flavor was great. I used the skillet method, which if you like the sticky sauce, you need to do. I heated my skillet and put the chicken in first, and then just poured the marinade over it after the chicken had a nice sear on both sides, just a couple of minutes. the marinade caramelizes and sticks to the chicken. I will definitely use this recipe often"
2002334509,140426,2018-12-13,5,Very glad to find this recipe again. One of mom's go to's. She had the recipe in her head! I've made it a few times myself but had forgotten about it. So easy to put together!
2002365423,80156,2018-12-13,5,I four times the recipe. Made 122 beautiful soft cookies ! Baked to the maximum of eight minutes. I used Pam on my pans
2002276855,68321,2018-12-13,5,Amazing recipe. Browning the butter tales it to the next level!
317873,32204,2018-12-13,4,"I’ve made this recipe many times, then I’ve got an idea to apply this recipe a little bit and want to share. ( Sorry for my poor English!) I like quite strong taste of chocolate so that I reduce sugar to 180 gm (from 200 gm or 1 cup) and add semi-sweet chocolate 50 gm into melted butter to make the texture more gooey. The result is so perfect. I’m not good at English so I will not explain how good it is but i’d like you to try my experiment. If you are sweet tooth, no need to cut the sugar off, I’m a bitter one !. From my picture, I make 3 toppings in the same tray chocolate chunk, walnits and almonds. (Just a few pieces of almonds because I don’t like it much but someone wants it). Enjoy !"
2002364540,76686,2018-12-13,5,"Yummy recipe. Easy to make. I added 5 drops of doTERRA Lime essential oil to the icing and it was delicious. I like that this cookie isn't over the top sweet. My only tip would be to make sure the cookies aren't too thin to avoid burning them. Otherwise, this recipe is on point! Thank you for sharing."
2001286745,2886,2018-12-13,5,Very yummy. I added a little cinnamon to it as another reviewer suggested. I can't wait until my family arrives home to try it.
2002365627,1356,2018-12-13,4,I use the same ingredients but I do not cook the beef. Otherwise it is basically the same recipe I use.
2002364849,30864,2018-12-13,2,"I'm not sure what I'm missing. I made this recipe because of the great reviews. Although the sauce was delicious (I doubled it (except for the vinegar), as recommended), the meat was so disappointing. It was dry and tough. I too had concerns about cooking it in the oven for that long with no liquid, but tried it anyway, with ultimate disappointment. Maybe my cubes were too small? Maybe I'm missing something? I have never cooked this cut of meat before. Perhaps another cut would be better. Although it seems this should be cooked in liquid and covered if for that long to tenderize. Would love to figure this out, as the reviews were great."
2002365431,26370,2018-12-13,5,"I did only the cake (already had the frosting) - cake is awesome... beautiful flavors, really smooth and light. Love this recipe, I will never buy box chocolate cake ever again"
2002364811,50719,2018-12-13,2,I was very disappointed with this recipe. I followed it exactly (almost) and the result was very greasy. I tried it because so many reviews remarked on the texture as being &quot;cake like.&quot; It was too greasy for my liking. The frozen blueberries bled into the dough even though I did not thaw them. So the result was a dirty blue mess. Will not use this recipe again.
2002365579,97496,2018-12-13,5,These are the best! I lost this recipe after making it several times for my students last year. I tried another snickerdoodle recipe and it didn't measure up. SO glad I found it again!
2002365467,18446,2018-12-13,5,"Delicious, made it with both good grated parmesan and the kraft green can, preferred kraft. Sprinkled paprika on top and broiled until brown...so good!"
498082,501328,2018-12-13,5,"This was delicious! Followed the recipe exactly, I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing Kalderlake!"
2002318834,60992,2018-12-13,5,This is amazing!
2002364974,98652,2018-12-13,5,"I've made 4 batches in 2 weeks...this is such an amazing recipe...My family, my friends are gobbling these up and I have to hide some for myself...I bake them for 10 minutes and they are soft and chewy and the house smells amazing too! I did add ginger paste - 1 additional teaspoon in the batch... I have 4 containers pre-measured with the dry ingredients ready to go for drop in company this holiday ... So good, thanks for the recipe!"
2002364936,51333,2018-12-13,5,I serve this with Bar-B-Que boneless short ribs with mashed potatoes and it is delicious. It is very similar to a savory Saskatoon berry sauce I had in a restaurant that was served with bison. That is why I went searching for a similar recipe. This one was perfect. I have made it many times.
2002365515,449452,2018-12-13,5,"This is my go-to chicken recipe when I can't use the grill or smoker... like rainy weekends and ... well, pretty much all winter. I usually use thighs instead of quarters."
198154,67930,2018-12-13,3,I used fresh pumpkin pur&eacute;e instead of canned. The batter was really thin and the texture was softer than we like. They get mushy before you can eat them once you add syrup. The flavor was fine. Next time I will play with the ingredient measurements and see if I can get them closer to a traditional waffle.
2002364923,149257,2018-12-13,5,"Highest rated recipe I could find. Tastes great and can be cooked hard for houses or soft for cookies. It’s a good go-to recipe. As far as adding the egg to a hot liquid, it worked fine because the butter (margarine)cools it down. Be careful about the heating. Boiling the sugar too long may get close to candy if not stirring and adding the butter pretty quick, The flour quantity is fine but you have to add it slowly and mix it in all the way each time. I rollled it really thin less than 1/8 inch for tea biscuits and 1/4 inch for house walls 1 foot long. It cooks best on stoneware. Especially the thin ones as they tend to overlook on the edges. Parchment paper helps but I noticed that on long pieces it causes ripples on the underside from the contraction of the cookie. Not much of issue if it is an inside wall of the house. If you want a really smooth back, flour it well and bake it right on the pan. That will also ensure even cooking. Take them out when puffy and before they look done. They will firm up when cooling. The dough is really easy to work with, my 4 yr old could smash, roll and cut her own cookies. Just keep adding flour to the work area. I personally think they could spicier but they taste good. Just don’t overcook, the 12 minutes in the instructions should only be for large thick house walls. Cookies were done in half that time. Remember thin dark pans cook faster. Stoneware is best."
2002364694,46877,2018-12-12,5,"My first time making shortbread and the reviews on this recipe made me want to try it over all the others available online. I did not regret it! I found I had to truly whip (electric mixer on high setting) for a few minutes before the texture of the dough was ready...the recipe title is accurate that these are whipped!!! Having said that, They are incredibly easy and simple to make, and they turned out beautifully: light, fluffy, melt-in-you-mouth goodness. My mother couldn’t get enough of them, so I’m making a second batch today! I am curious what the difference in texture would be if I refrigerated the dough for 30 minutes prior to baking?? Thank you uncle bill for this recipe!!!"
2002364091,381817,2018-12-12,5,"I, too, have been using this recipe since infancy! It's the ONLY cheesecake recipe I use. If you follow it exactly you will have a perfect product. I especially appreciated the notes about the temperature of the ingredients. So true. Enjoy! And thanks for posting this so I can share easily with others."
1462970,74608,2018-12-12,3,"I found this dough to be terribly sticky...so sticky that it couldn't be manipulated, even after several hours of refrigeration. I followed the recipe exactly. My butter was soft (room temp), maybe that was the problem? The taste of the cookie was soft, and good. Great gingerbread cookie, not so much as a gingerbread man!"
2123645,166164,2018-12-12,5,"Excellent! I doubled the sauce to brush more on after baking. Deliciously sweet, spicy, and sticky!"
42309018,433505,2018-12-12,5,"Thank You... I'd tried many Mayo recipes in the past.. but this one is great... and YES.. I concur with Greatful.... Any/Most of the mainstream oils labeled &quot; Vegetable Oil, Canola Oil, Corn Oil&quot; Sold at the grocery store are TOXIC... either GMO, Petroleum by-products, etc.. I now ONLY use GHEE, Coconut, and Olive oils in ALL my cooking.. I use Coconut oils that have no coconut flavor to them.. and GHEE is expensive at the store, but you can make it cheaply yourself at home. It's basically Clarified Butter.. You just heat up butter and skim off the milkfat... making it butter with a high smoke point... and it keeps in the pantry for months with no refrigeration needed. =)"
2000462805,130692,2018-12-12,5,These caramels are delicious! I have tried many times to make them but this is the BEST recipe. I did add a pinch of salt and and an extra tsp. Of vanilla to make them PERFECT.
400708,80413,2018-12-12,5,"OMG, these turned out sooooo good and so much better than store bought, I'll never buy them again. Using the bread machine made it easy and the results - Wow!! I did brush mine before baking with an egg white and top with toasted sesame seeds, the inside of these came out pillowy soft, but still firm enough to stand up to all our hamburger fixings. As I said, NEVER buy store bought again"
2002364395,2886,2018-12-12,4,"I made this recipe today however I did some minor tweeking. I omitted the vanilla, added 1/8 tsp. Cinnamon and added some grated orange zest to it. The results are amazing!! Moist tasty mini banana breads and the orange zest was the perfect touch. Thanks for the recipe!"
2002364067,89861,2018-12-12,5,"When I came to Canada 45 years ago, my UK recipe for pastry did not work. The flour is a higher concentrate of hard wheat and therefore has more gluten. Madame Benoit published her lemon tang pastry in the Toronto Star one weekend after I arrived. I have been using it ever since and here are the proportions from the scrappy piece of newspaper clipping I still have. 5 cups flour, &frac12; tsp sofa, 2 tsp sugar, 2 tsp salt, 1 lb lard (did taste better when you get get real lard then), 3 tbsp lemon juice, I egg and water to make the lemon juice and egg up to one cup. In her book “cooks at home” she replaces the lemon juice with 2 tbsp vinegar and the granulated sugar with 1 tbsp brown sugar. I like the lemon one better but is it a question of personal preference. You can throw this pastry against the wall and it would still come out tender and flaky!!"
2002363779,294643,2018-12-12,5,"This was a perfect way to use up some leftover salmon! It was so yummy. I followed the directions exactly, except that I didn’t have dill so I substituted Old Bay. So good!"
2002363736,80156,2018-12-12,0,Terrible. Super dry. Could not roll out at all. Waste of time and ingredients.
1242099,274110,2018-12-12,5,"Super delicious. Like some other reviewers, we used bacon rather than bacon bits (about 6 slices cooked on the stovetop, then chopped into small pieces). I can honestly say that it was so flavorful that I don't think bacon is required at all (and I'm not a fan of bacon bits). Also, I used only 3/4 cup cream, because soups are sometimes too creamy for my. It was perfect... and my husband loved it (he's a cream lover)."
2002335375,26969,2018-12-12,3,I made this without the &quot;spice essence&quot; and fewer Serrano peppers. It was really good. Had I made it per the recipe it would have been too hot. I asked for the ingredients of the spice essence and never got a reply. I was sorely disappointed.
2002364147,38298,2018-12-12,5,Delicious and not hard to make at all. Our family loved it. It was barely enough for 4 adults and 1 child. Next time I'll double it!
2001048322,14979,2018-12-12,5,"I had never made banana cream pie, but someone asked me if I would make it for her anniversary. I was really nervous that I would choose the wrong recipe, but this one is a keeper! I topped it with a stabilized whipped cream recipe from another website. I didn't even know I liked banana cream pie until I tried this one. Thanks!!"
2002364298,47844,2018-12-12,0,"One of my family's breakfast traditions. There is nothing that says off church Sunday morning to me! As others have pointed out, this recipe needs black pepper added to taste. Roger"
2002363856,402909,2018-12-12,5,This recipe is easy to make and super delicious. A keeper!
2001907643,108105,2018-12-12,5,"I use this recipe as a marinade for both chicken or pork chops. I eliminate the flour and use 1 1/2 Tbsp. of olive oil and 1/2 Tbsp. of sesame oil. I use chicken thighs, bone in or pork chops, bone in and marinate the meat in the mixture for several hours. This is great when grilled or on top of the stove."
221734,148927,2018-12-12,5,also... see my (Carrie Sheridan) lemon spritz cookies...very refreshing...and a variation on these... AND russian butter cookies that vaporize in your mouth -
2001904942,394616,2018-12-12,3,"I was very bored with this recipe. It was beautifully flakey and light, however the breading had no flavor! I’ll try it again but next time I’m going to add to the seasoning. I will try it with lemon zest, coconut aminos, more pepper, and dried parsley."
2002233920,398841,2018-12-12,5,Doubled the recipe and used one 15 ounce can of pumpkin rather than 2 cups. Turned out great!. No frosting needed. Pumpkin and cheesecake - delish!
2002364557,162190,2018-12-12,2,"Not a Tempura Batter at all. I used the Rice Flour and I personally Did not like it. Its barely at batter, more of a very light coating. The Shrimp is all i could taste in this recipe, I like that Thick Crunchy Puffy Batter. I'll be using my AP flour next time."
2002321540,204449,2018-12-12,5,Great recipe as-is and easy to make!
2002363832,234344,2018-12-12,0,"Thanks for the recipe!!! I feel like $&amp;@%! and this taste wonderful! I tweaked it though based on what I had at hand. I used Jefferson’s Ocean Bourbon, raw organic honey, Sleepytime herbal tea, fresh Meyer lemon juice and fresh lemon slice from that same lemon. Currently cuddled in the blanket...waiting for this deliciousness to kick in...."
2002294030,226503,2018-12-12,5,Wonderfully moist unlike typical bran muffins. Added frozen huckleberries instead of raisins the first time and they were great. Cut back on the brown sugar to 1/2 cup when I used raisins to balance the sweetness.
2002364382,194101,2018-12-12,1,I just made the Holiday Ham Balls for a gathering tonight. I tried them out and they were not a hit with me. The doughy texture distracts from the taste and the cheese and ham are barely noted. Time and materials wasted.
395981,54351,2018-12-12,5,Finally found a good oatmeal cookie recipe! Soaking the raisins is key in order to plump them up. I've soaked them in boiling water before but never like this. Worked perfectly. This is how my go-to recipe!
1623620,150384,2018-12-12,5,"I cannot believe it took me so long to try this soup! I have been missing out! My whole family loved it. I consider myself the #1 fan of Panera‘s broccoli cheddar soup (literally...I order it every single time I go) and I have to say, I think this one tops it??? It’s rich and creamy and ever so slightly thicker than Panera‘s version, and I mean that in the best way! We didn’t even have bread to dip in it and it was still amazing. Adding to my recipe book now!"

2002360043,394065,2018-12-11,0,I usually pair this with a grilled sausage or chicken breast. A dynamite side - there's never any leftover!
2002363003,89164,2018-12-11,5,Turned out wonderfully. Made half into rolls and half into loaf. I had some difficulty slicing the loaf even with a bread knife. Any tips for easier slicing?
2002329771,256395,2018-12-11,5,Made these for a Christmas cookie exchange and they've turned out perfectly. Stuck exactly to recipe except: 1. Chilled dough overnight (out of convenience) 2. Subbed peppermint oil for vanilla. They turned out absolutely divine. Fudgey and sweet and Christmasey.
2002362925,80435,2018-12-11,2,"Not a relieable recipe. Used the exact pan, and it ended up being way to big for only 4 noodles per layer. I would've had a half inch of extra pan left. Also seemed like a bit to little meat. It was edible but pretty disappointed."
2061935,220976,2018-12-11,5,"This was delicious! I found those noodles at the Publix, and they were great! I had to use some sausage crumbles because I didn't have enough ham, but that was fine. Next time I'm buying large curd cottage cheese to make draining easier. :) I was going to take a pic, but the boys gobbled it up! Thanks for an easy recipe that reminds me of verenyky!"

2002363330,2175,2018-12-11,5,I made these popcorn balls for years and they always turn out great. I use buttered microwave popcorn. Yummm. Kids live em.
2002363091,225613,2018-12-11,3,"So the flavors in this recipe were amazing. I'm dating a Turkish man and he said they tasted exactly like the ones there. However I had a large issue with the rice. What kind of rice is to be used? I used long grain brown rice as I don't like white rice. I couldn't get the rice translucent. I stirred it in the pot for at least an hour, it simply would not become translucent. I decided there was nothing more I could do, rolled the mixture into the leaves and cooked. The finished product was disappointing, the rice was not cooked all the way as I feared it would be. I was let down by this because making these was not a simple task."
2002362260,140261,2018-12-11,5,So I just made this but tweaked it for Christmas. Substituted 1/2 the choc chips with white peppermint chips and sprinkled crushed candy cane on top. Also used salted butter since I didn't have unsalted and just ommited the salt. It came out great!
2002363333,125710,2018-12-11,5,I let the ribs marinate for a few days in the fridge. Very tasty mix of seasonings! It's hard to stop eating!
2002321157,63515,2018-12-11,5,"I added 1 TB of Grand Marnier because I had some on hand, substituted dark brown sugar for half of the sugar, and 2-1/2TB butter for the shortening. Only needed 45 minutes in my oven. It was very tasty, worth making again!"
2002363181,394114,2018-12-11,5,"Great recipe! Just a quick trick; I sifted my crushed peppermint and mixed the peppermint dust into the white chocolate and sprinkled the rest on top, and it turned out delicious!! Nice lil crunches throughout the bark.."

198154,23113,2018-12-11,4,"I made this as a side because DH is a meat and potatoes kind of guy. I got a package of fresh sliced mushrooms from the produce department and just threw the whole thing in. Being December, I wasn't able to use fresh parsley from the garden. I have some that I dried at the end of the season so I just adjusted the amount accordingly and used that. It was just my husband and me tonight. But, we both really enjoyed it. In fact he was hesitant and only took a little at first, but went back for more after trying it."
2002363663,48356,2018-12-11,0,"well, the cookies themselves taste mediocre, but the amount of ingredients was absolutely excessive. the recipe says to use an ungreased cookie sheet, which i was a little suspicious of, but I just went along with the recipe..... The cookies will not come off of the sheet."
2002179259,392356,2018-12-11,4,"I've cooked bacon this way for years. I line the sheet with foil and drain the grease into a jar to keep in the fridge. I do not put pepper on it. The only thing I think is important to note is that the bacon almost never SEEMS crispy until it is removed from the grease. I do by how the bacon LOOKS, not how it actually feels. Then I place it on paper towels after 8 remove it from the oven to get rid of some more of the grease and THEN it will be crispy."
2002362733,80156,2018-12-11,5,"Amazing recipe.They turned out great! I didn't let them sit out for 2 hours because I got impatient,but they were still delicious"
2002363219,184710,2018-12-11,4,"I have made this recipe 4x and I think the bread has turned out pretty good. I am using a Hamilton Beach bread maker on the basic cycle on light crust, 2lbs. The bread comes out really fluffy. It's perfect for chili! I definitely think that you need to add some additional spices. 3 jalapenos fairly deseeded doesn't feel spicy enough to me. I added garlic and onion powder, basil, oregano, thyme, and red pepper flakes. I also increased the chz amount to a cup. I can't taste it as easily but I can smell it baking."
2002363416,80156,2018-12-11,0,So good. They stay soft and I got so many compliments on them.
2000960610,72108,2018-12-10,4,Flavors were spot on. Soup was a bit thick for me and would add more milk or water to thin it out. Added cayenne pepper per review and although I propably didn't add enough gave a hint of spiciness.
2002280267,526408,2018-12-10,4,"Very good marinade. Added more garlic. I roasted it at 450 for 15 minutes, fat cap on top, then roasted at 300 until done, about 35 minutes later, using a meat thermometer for a 5 lb roast. Served it with a little Dijon on the side. 60 minutes would be way too long for a 2 lb roast."
227652,19653,2018-12-10,5,"These cookies were wonderful. I've had this in my saves for a long time now, waiting for the holiday season! I apologize for not putting my tweaks under tweaks. In a bit of a hurry but wanted to thank previous reviews for helping me. I used 2 eggs, and I needed all the flour (I think some people said they didn't need it all). I also added 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt. The dough was easy to roll, and I'm new to rolling out cookies. I believe my cookies took 8 min at 350. I've wanted to do shaped cookies for a long time; wasn't sure if I had the skills. After learning how to roll things like pizza dough I started to feel more confident to handle cookies. This recipe was a big blessing a big help for me!"
1802567925,154142,2018-12-10,1,"This recipe is not helpful to beginners. It states about altitude? Unproofed? Doesn't mention what dough should look or feel like after the first addition of flour to the starter. Poorly written. Before I wasted my starter that I cared for and nurtured for quite some time, I went to King Arthur Flour, and low and behold an instructional recipe , and a beautiful loaf of bread."
2001820368,536564,2018-12-10,5,"EXCELLENT! Subbed frozen corn, but that was the only change. My hubby said it was not only the best quiche he's ever had, but one of the top things I've made (and I cook a lot!). Nice job on this recipe. :)"
1800236093,258145,2018-12-10,5,Made this recipe with organic ginger and raw wildflower honey and it was a showstopper!
2002144249,20235,2018-12-10,5,450 degrees is too hot. Normally Wonton recipes say to cook between 350-375 F.
961636,148677,2018-12-10,5,"My mom made these when I was a kid, shhhhh, in th 60's... my favorite, my boys too!! I use NO nuts...."
40128019,381868,2018-12-10,5,I was looking for a more pulp/less sugar recipe and this fit the bill. It was not overly sweet and it was delicious.
2002361928,27781,2018-12-10,4,"These were WAY too sweet; I made them with 1/2 cup sugar in the batter and 1/8 cup in the topping and I still found that the sugar overwhelmed the other flavors and made the result disappointing. I did not have Granny Smith apples on hand, their tartness would have helped. If I ever make them again, I will not only cut down the sugar further but add oats and fresh ginger."
2002351960,303245,2018-12-10,5,I love this recipe! I have made this several times. I have received so many compliments on them. Thank-You for sharing!
2002361737,344340,2018-12-10,5,"The hot pepper jelly cheesecake is amazing! It’s so delicious and easy to make. I would have taken a photo, but it didn’t last too long in its whole state for a pretty picture."
2002361401,265591,2018-12-10,4,These took longer to make than noted. I added Christmas sprinkles since for a holiday office swap. They only yielded a little over 4 dozen rather than 5 so I had to make more than one batch.
2001013114,120644,2018-12-10,5,"Awesome recipe! Well worth the effort. Just when I thought I'd done something wrong and ruined it because it wouldn't come together as I kneaded, it came together. Fab shortbread! Thanks for the recipe and &quot;instructions&quot;. If it hadn't been for the over-instructing I wouldn't have kept kneading."
756851,299473,2018-12-10,4,"Made this for a potluck. The molasses, ketchup, and spices flavor the lentils so that they taste very much like traditional baked beans. The ground beef adds a meatier flavor than the ham or bacon that you would generally add to a standard baked bean recipe. I liked them better with sour cream than plain, but they were so similar to baked beans that they are best offered as a side dish rather than an entr&eacute;e."
2002362510,532289,2018-12-10,1,"Awful, flavorless and gritty. Spent money on all the ingredients and will probably throw the entire thing out. The ramen noodles we buy at the grocery store take almost 6 hours to digest fully in your stomach so I was looking for a healthier alternative but this is definitely not it."
2002361820,423314,2018-12-10,3,I always use chicken cubes
2002361851,149257,2018-12-10,1,"The wet and dry ratio for this recipe was way off. I make ginger bread houses with my kids every year, but we couldn’t even roll this crumbly dough and ended up throwing it out."
306951,50588,2018-12-10,5,"I made this recipe, with a total 1 kilo of meat, in the form of meatballs and then pan fried them, and served them over brown basmati rice. I omitted the sugar, and used a food processor to mix the meat and spices, as well as 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. The flavour was delicious - these were exactly the right spices. Balanced, so that you could taste all of them, but not overwhelming. I am South African and loved them, and my husband who isn't also really enjoyed them."
2884481,9272,2018-12-10,5,One of the best salsa recipes ever! Its very scalable and I make several gallons at a time to preserve in Ball jars. Great gifts for friends and family but really like to keep for myself. Its that time for another batch!!
1803234286,46877,2018-12-10,5,I have been making these cookies for the holidays for a couple of years now. My family enjoys these so much. They are good with raspberry jam too.
2002362634,63071,2018-12-10,5,"This recipe came out perfect, crispy exterior, light and fluffy interior. We tried several others and weren't happy with them. Thanks for sharing!"
2002362042,536973,2018-12-10,5,"Delicious. Thank you Jonathan. Husband and son loved the meatballs. They are not adventurous eaters so this is a good recipe to sneak in. After all, who doesn't love meatballs?"
2002006749,199849,2018-12-10,5,"Made this yesterday and substituted a cheddar cheese crust for a regular pie crust. Brought it in for the &quot;lunch bunch&quot; and every one LOVED it. I reduced the amount of cloves to just a pinch and substituted thyme for savory as others suggested. It was absolutely FABULOUS. Everyone loved it and although someone brought out the ketchup (said they always put it on a pork pie), no one touched the ketchup. RAVE reviews from my colleagues. Delicious!!! I've had other pork pies that used mashed potatoes as the binder, but this beats any that I have had. I'll be making this one again!"
2001362355,104700,2018-12-09,5,Loved the combination of the chocolate and peppermint. Beautiful Christmas cookies with green food coloring.
2002361430,226118,2018-12-09,4,"I gotta agree with Carol.... wayyyyy too many ingredients for one quiche, I'd probably cut this recipe in half to make the right amount for one 9 inch pie crust. By the time I put it all in to one the egg mix was over flowing, and that was when I didn't even put in all of the spinach cheese mixture...so I ended up wasting a bit of food. The 12 inch pie crust probably would be fine for this amount (maybe this should be specified above for the ingredients?) . Otherwise an awesome recipe!!! Next time I'll add meet. Thanks!!!"
2407654,33378,2018-12-09,1,"Okay, I tried making this but couldn't believe 5 cups of uncooked so I cooked 2 cups which yielded probably 5 cups. I only used 4 1/2 cups but it's in the oven for 45 minutes and is still soupy. I really wanted to try this because all the stuff sounded like it would be great together. I stuck a fork in to taste it and I immediately don't like the lemon zest. Geez, I think I wasted a perfectly good can of salmon. I put peas in it for color and veggies but I don't know if I'll try to fix this and try it again or not. Very disappointed. Maybe 5 cups of uncooked pasta was right. Way too much food for little ole me."
198154,121066,2018-12-09,4,"I doubled the garlic and felt that it could use more, but we big garlic fans! I may add a little more of the other spices. Over all, a quick and tasty meal. We enjoyed it."
85414,37706,2018-12-09,5,"Delicious! Pretty quick, too."
315055,69173,2018-12-09,5,"This is our go to meatball recipe. Turns out wonderfully every time! Thanks for another winner, kittencal!"
2002361607,107273,2018-12-09,5,LOVE LOVE this recipe i made a different one and it didn’t come out at all right the fact i knew what temperature to cook til made a huge difference
209747,147961,2018-12-09,5,Wonderful! I made this with two gallon bags of shrimp shells saved over a few months. Didn't have a leek so added an extra onion. Also added a half cup of Chardonnay at the end. Brilliant recipe!
2002361044,283952,2018-12-09,5,GREAT!!!! My daughter's favorite way to eat noodles! Very easy and very good!
2002361646,266161,2018-12-09,5,I made this with boneless beef ribs and modified the recipe! Instead of chili flakes I added 2 table spoons of chili paste. I also added an additional 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of pineapple juice.. would reccomend maybe 1 - 1/2 tbls of sesame oil as it was very strong in this recipe
2002361443,60350,2018-12-09,3,"This is my first time making homemade Mac n Cheese. The consistency turned out great but it just tastes like flour. I used extra sharp cheddar cheese. I couldn't taste the cheese at all, even after adding more. Inormally prefer bland food but Mac n Flour Sauce was not tasty."
2002361425,55568,2018-12-09,5,"I cannot bake a boxed cake mix right but I made this and it tasted great! I had made a mistake and thought the bottle was vanilla extract but it was actually Anise. My friend said it smelled odd, told her it probably was the Hennesy cognac. I thought it smelled like licorice when it was baking. My raisins were as hard as rocks so I soaked them in some Hennessy XO. Anyways it came out really good, tastes like my Nana's Italian easter bread. Now I want to try it with vanilla and fresh raisins, although the soak in liquor made them taste really good. This was even better when toasted with butter!"
2002361386,77601,2018-12-09,5,This recipe is very helpful and delicious! i have no experience with candy making but this was very easy! it did take me a few tries to get it right but it tastes AMAZING!!
2000003389,181106,2018-12-09,0,"Okay! Waiting patiently for this dbsnova 100%wwb recipe to cool down! I just submitted my photo!! I'm so stoked about everything up to this point, the ratio of ingredients, the mixing of said, the kneading, the first rise, the degassing, the splitting and forming into two loaves, baking... OhMmGee!! So ready to slather the real butter on it! THANK YOU NOVA!"
1052873,503349,2018-12-09,4,Easy to prepare except I had a lot of trouble with the eggs. I had to turn them over to set.
2002232072,110047,2018-12-09,5,"This is a great recipe, only made one tiny change. I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup, they're combined in the same can. For the options I used skinless/boneless thighs, seasoned and baked before chopping, the mayo/sour cream mixed, jarred roasted red peppers (coarsely chopped), 8 pack of Pillsbury Grand biscuits and one can of peas (drained). This fits perfectly in a 11x7 baking dish. For serving, I flip the biscuits over so that the gravy is over the biscuit. I froze the left-overs and they did well. This is such an awesome comfort food."
2000915967,537242,2018-12-09,5,"I really enjoyed making these cookies. Directions were right on! And the best part,,,delicious!"
2002361642,194101,2018-12-09,5,Made these for a party and served with pepper mustard as a dipping sauce. I used shredded parmesan in the balls and then rolled in grated parmesan before baking. They were a hit.
2002306839,465521,2018-12-09,4,"this recipe is PRETTY good, although it does need some changes - this coming from a gal originally from Syracuse, NY - the HOME of the Dinosaur BBQ! The sugar should be BROWN sugar, the mustard HAS TO BE Zatarain's Creole mustard (they would NEVER use anything else), and the amount of tabasco should be tripled. Best mac and cheese in the world. Hands down."
550557,187417,2018-12-09,5,Perfect!
2002360565,38298,2018-12-09,5,I used spicy italian sausage and this was DELISH and wasn't hard to make. My husband said &quot;this is the best thing you have ever made.&quot; Definitely saving for later!
218535,322598,2018-12-09,1,Directions on cooking time is bad. 25-60 mins???
2002361612,22539,2018-12-09,4,"Very good. My family likes saut&eacute;ed onion, peppers, mushrooms, and wilted baby spinach added. Get those veggies in them! I also make my own sauce which has a kick of red pepper flakes for heat."
2001409582,479196,2018-12-09,5,"Hubby &amp; family absolutely LOVED this!! I set 3 huge FROZEN boneless skinless breasts into the crockpot.... then heavily covered them with sweet baby ray's honey bbq sauce, poured a 1/4 lemon juice into the bottom, then covered all the bbq sauce with brown sugar &amp; garlic powder. 4 hours later: DELISH !!!! Served it with lotsa mashed sweet potatoes &amp; peas. Mmmmmm {ps. I have been putting frozen chicken into our crockpot here for dinners for over 25 years now and no one has ever ever ever gotten sick.}"
2002361267,532289,2018-12-09,1,Do NOT use all the pepper that is listed!
2002361548,454978,2018-12-09,1,Tasted pretty bad honestly. Added Kahlua which helped and balanced out the liquid with a tiny bit more butter.
2002360756,380988,2018-12-09,5,Fluffiest white bread I’ve ever made!! Ran out of plain white flour and made it with bread (hi protein) flour instead! Love the recipe!!
2728060,330734,2018-12-09,0,Made this for Sunday dinner last Sunday. Excellent. Very moist with great flavor. My new go to whole chicken recipe. Thanks CarrolJ
2002360605,380988,2018-12-09,1,"What a huge mess!!!!!!! Try telling us what size of loaf this is supposed to be before having us try the recipe! I have a huge mess on my hands, a lot of cleanup, a lot of wasted ingredients and a major disappointment for my husband who was so looking forward to fresh bread. I read another review who said she made a 2 pound loaf, how is that possible?"
2002360942,148845,2018-12-09,0,this recipe DOES NOT make 120 cookies...not even close to that
2002361415,77861,2018-12-09,5,Best turkey ever. The only adjustments I made were putting a whole onion inside the turkey with the buttery spice mixture and throwing in celery and red potatoes (but the latter was added towards the end). This is the best anything that I’ve ever cooked per the husband. Thank you!
2000723002,188723,2018-12-09,5,"I had this when I was a kid, and I am so happy I found the recipe. My 2-year-old loves it!"
40958820,228913,2018-12-09,5,"Pork and apricots are one of my favorite combinations, add curry spices and I’m unable to control myself. I used dried apricots instead of canned and it was sweet enough. Added a bit of garam masala and some Kashmiri pepper for a bit of heat. Love this recipe!"
2000249961,145038,2018-12-08,5,Yummsers ! only spice I added was onion powder ! It got a Big Ole 5 ! … O
2002359890,265680,2018-12-08,1,I wish I would have read the reviews prior to making this. The pancakes were dry and lacking flavor. Worst pancakes I have ever had despite following the recipe to a t.
2002359631,485579,2018-12-08,5,I made the tandoori paste it was amazing thanks for the recipe
2001543166,141737,2018-12-08,5,"Simple Chinese Noodles and quick to make , thank you. Followed the recipe exactly as is. Will add optional broccoli next time"
2002359363,423064,2018-12-08,1,This recipe didn't work. I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't set up at all. Also I can taste the vinegar slightly in the syrupy jelly.
2002321540,278922,2018-12-08,4,Pretty good stuff. Maybe a little less vinegar next time.
2002360193,14906,2018-12-08,4,"As-is, the cookies taste just fine. The eggnog flavor was very, very mild, so I decided to add a bit more to my dough AND make a glaze: 1 c. powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and 1/4 c. Eggnog. With my tweaks, my friends and family gave this recipe 5 stars!"
2001362355,17615,2018-12-08,5,I actually added a little cherry juice to the cookies for a nice pink color. Great taste!
454137,21761,2018-12-08,0,These were delicious! I'm doing them this way again tonight!
2002360398,296743,2018-12-08,0,"I have been making these ribs for many, many years. At least since 2012, when I first noticed this recipe. Thought is was about time to do a review. My family loves this recipe. Whenever we go to a restaurant/smoke house that boast the best ribs, my family always feels that they are not as good as these. Most times they won't even order the ribs on the menu. Nothing compares. The sauce brings out the flavour of the ribs and doesn't disguise them. So simple and so tasty."
2000265767,103403,2018-12-08,5,"Family and friends love this, too. Get requests to make this recipe often!"
2002360118,452478,2018-12-08,5,
2002359451,50722,2018-12-08,5,"This recipe turns out, is forgiving, flexible, and convenient. Throw away that junk in a can, save your money in the bakery, and enjoy fresh, delicious, simple cinnamon rolls in a snap with this recipe. Thank You!"
2002359020,339453,2018-12-08,0,My 20 lb. Turkey came out fantastic. Cooking time was about a 1/2 hour shorter than I figured it would take. I used a Thermopro digital thermometer in the breast &amp; at 165 deg. It was done perfect.
2002312313,63786,2018-12-08,5,Awesome and Easy. I did up the spices a bit on 2nd try
2002359519,395966,2018-12-08,5,"Everyone was right. This a fabulous recipe and we plan on making it again. Since some of us can't have seeds, I omitted them. The bread was lovely and dense with a slight slight sweetness."
2002359523,433745,2018-12-08,0,I was a Training Manager for McDonald's when the switch was made. What people didn't know was that the frozen fries were coated with beef tallow and fried in vegetable oil. Within a few months some nutritionist checked and found the beef tallow in the fries. They stopped and that was that. The fries never stayed as crispy or tasted as good after. BTW-note how gourmet restaurants now advertise fries cooked in natural fats.
2002359619,360032,2018-12-08,5,"Delicious! Taste as good as any cookie recipe with eggs. I didn’t have baking powder, so I used self-raising flour instead of regular flour. I also added dark and white chocolate chips."
1058821,207872,2018-12-08,5,"This was amazing. Kids had 3rds. I had over 3 lbs of Salmon 1/2d the butter and increased everything else by 3. Moving so no pans put it on a pizza pan. I also had added garlic I sauted in the butter before covering the fish with it. Trying to eat fish more often and looking for good, easy, quick ways to make it. This will be made often."
2001079574,31807,2018-12-08,3,Time was wrong. Chicken was over cooking so I had to turn it off of broil and flip the chicken. Took one hour 10 minutes.
1846291,143690,2018-12-07,2,Not good.
2002359225,114392,2018-12-07,5,"This is delicious! Mine turned out a bit like vodka sauce somehow. I saut&eacute;ed the veggies in the oil and butter using my instant pot, then added everything else before pressure cooking for a few minutes as someone else suggested. A bit extra on sugar and some honey for bitter adjustment, a splash of chardonnay, and I always go big on garlic, too. Thank you, this will be my new go-to for pizza sauce."
2002358622,320710,2018-12-07,5,Excellent recipe! Changes: I used 1 cup - 2 tbsp a/p flour + 2 tbsp cornstarch instead of cake flour. I also used 1.5 cups of egg whites in the carton even though they say not to use it for Angel food cake. It still turned out absolutely delicious!!
2002359115,15242,2018-12-07,5,"Made this for an annual Christmas brunch last weekend and it was a big hit. Easy and tasty - I recommend this for anyone who doesn't have a lot of time, but wants a crowd-pleaser!"
2000851208,11474,2018-12-07,5,"D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! I veganized the recipe by using vegan butter as well as a vegan coconut ice cream with burnt caramel. I also used a little less brown sugar, as well as tablespoon of rum coffee liquor. Two thumbs up!"
2002358768,118545,2018-12-07,5,"Oh my was this dangerously good! Adding to a question, I used heavy cream. I did double the recipe as is and I made this in well greased muffin tins for mini sizes. Only fill half way, as they rise a bit and made about 24 mini (remember I doubled).Baking only needed to be about 20 minutes. I did use the convection and I agree that maybe next time I wouldn't because the were a little dark but they still tasted incredible. I could see an adult version with a bit of rum might be nice too."
305531,537458,2018-12-07,5,"Yummy potatoes. These are really simple to make and delish. So creamy and good. Thanks for sharing, Bonnie."
493093,286047,2018-12-07,1,"This was the first time I tried frozen meatballs. I bought ones that had better on-line reviews. They had the flavor of ground cardboard. Didn't taste much in the dish besides BBQ sauce. If you still decide to try it, by all means make your own meatballs !"
2002060344,3199,2018-12-07,4,LIke a cross between cake and bread. Very tasty. Liked it especially toasted with butter.
2002359250,107786,2018-12-07,5,I first found your recipe over the summer. Everyone in my family cooks ribs but they never come out the way they should. I tried this recipe and I am the only one allowed to make the ribs now! They are incredible. Cooking time in oven varies. My oven cooks them in 90 minutes. Add bbq sauce and toss on grill for 2 minutes each side. Delicious every time. No leftovers! Thank you for this recipe!
2001845741,97496,2018-12-07,5,Very happy with the results. I used margarine instead of butter &amp; they turned out great. It made 48 cookies - small/medium sized. I will use this recipe again.
2002358995,4271,2018-12-07,5,"I always come back to this recipe (just the basic vanilla version) as it's just a solid pudding recipe. I've started using only 1/2 cup sugar and that is perfect for us. I don't use a double boiler - just a sauce pan. I let the mixture come almost to a boil before adding the tempered egg mixture. Then let it come to a boil again. Consistency is perfectly thick for my tastes. Sometimes I only have two egg yolks, and it hasn't hurt the outcome. Thanks for a great recipe!"
2002312797,105080,2018-12-07,2,"Way too much onion, it overpowered all the other ingredients. The dish is quite bland with just regular cheese. Maybe I'm sentimental, but although it's harder to find (probably not the healthier option), Cheese-Whiz for the win!"
165217,116181,2018-12-07,0,The book she got it from is called &quot;Top Secret Recipes&quot; by Todd Wilbur. It is customary to give the author credit.
2002359165,269925,2018-12-07,1,Making these currently. This recipe yielded a batter rather than a dough. I have no idea how this is going to bake.
2002066937,227127,2018-12-07,5,"Since finding this recipe, I use it once every week. My kids and grandkids just love it. And it really, truly is STUPID EASY!!!"
2002358741,138459,2018-12-07,4,"I make these using 1/2 cup light tasting olive oil (I avoid canola). It works just as well, cuts the calories a lot. You can also use extra virgin olive oil and dry Italian dressing mix for a different flavor."
2002359242,97496,2018-12-07,5,"I've made these cookies well over 10 times. I double the vanilla extract (personal preference) and as I'm too lazy to pick of cream of tartar, that is always left out. These are one of my favourite cookies of all time."
2002347943,48494,2018-12-07,5,What a great alternative to fried latkes! Delicious and super easy. Much less work than standing at the fryer.
2002358411,505862,2018-12-07,2,I think this recipe is a great foundation. It provides you with a direction but you better know what you're doing in the kitchen if you want to use this recipe. We substituted ham for the chicken as that's what we had in the fridge and treated the seasonings as a &quot;ranch packet&quot; (added dried parsley and dill). I cut the salt in half as the ham and cheese had oodles of salt (but the potatoes did soak some up) and using monterey jack cheese is a must to get that creaminess!
2002358451,61297,2018-12-07,1,This is absolutely awful. It's like eating raw sugar flavoured with some vanilla and apples. It's like a pineapple upside down cake and an apple cobbler made a horribly disfigured baby. It's like someone dropped an upsidedown cake in a puddle and then threw some apples on it a a cover...Sometimes things aren't meant to be mixed... This is one of those times.
2002300982,67612,2018-12-07,0,This is my favourite cheesecake but extremely rich. I make it exactly as it's written but with 2 packs of lite cream cheese instead of 3. It's so smooth &amp; rich &amp; delicious but you only need a small piece.
2002358864,266529,2018-12-07,1,"In a small bowl, stir together 1 cup confectioners' sugar and 2 Tsp milk until smooth. Beat in 2 Tsp corn syrup and 1/4 tsp almond extract until icing is smooth and glossy. If icing is too thick, add more corn syrup. Divide into separate bowls, and add food colorings to each to desired intensity. Dip cookies, or paint them with a brush."
2001051242,537716,2018-12-06,5,These were the best game day sandwiches. I could probably eat 50 and feel fantastic about it.
2002358033,349246,2018-12-06,2,the batter was good but my brownie did not cook in the microwave at all......
2002357638,58843,2018-12-06,1,Hope you like taco meat cause that's what it tastes like.
1633968,144962,2018-12-06,5,"I made this for myself at Thanksgiving. I used splenda and pumpkin pie spice instead of using the individual sources, as I was out of cloves. This was very good. I might add just a little less of the splenda next time."
2002358270,199186,2018-12-06,5,"My mom started making this hot chocolate when I was little. She has altered it a little, and I wanted to share it with everyone! Instead of using regular white sugar, she uses light brown sugar. Instead of baking chocolate she just uses the semisweet chocolate morsels and the white chocolate chip morsels. We dont end up with a bunch of chocolate on the bottom of the crockpot! I hope this helped everyone!"
2002357716,101451,2018-12-06,0,I hate rhubarb but this shortbread recipe was amazing. Tastes so good and easy to make. Did I say I hate rhubarb?
2002357569,153642,2018-12-06,0,"Very easy to make, didn't have enough blueberries but still look and taste amazing. ????"
400708,428341,2018-12-06,4,"DH and I enjoyed this for dinner, we served over steamed rice as that's what I had, also added some onions and mushrooms to the mix of veggies just for a little extra. Once you have everything together came together fast. Loved the method for grilling the lemons and it added a pleasant slight fresh taste to the whole meal."
2002355167,348200,2018-12-06,3,"I used more fresh minced garlic than the recipe called for, probably about 3-4 tablespoons. I also used some dry thyme as I didn't have fresh. I used everything else that was called for, although I did use low sodium chicken stock. I did soak the beans overnight and cooked on high for 5 hours (for advice under the questions on this recipe). The beans were perfectly cooked. When we got home from my daughter's cheer practice and tried it, it was perfectly cooked but it was rather bland. I had to use quite a bit of salt and more dried thyme. It was pretty good once I did that, but I don't know if I'd make it again, to be honest. It was ok, just not fantastic for both my daughter and myself. We'll see what my husband says when he tries it after work."
2002269644,301062,2018-12-06,0,My only problem with making this bread was mixing the ingredients. Directions said not to overmix but I found it difficult- batter was very thick and couldn’t get good blend. Haven’t eaten any yet but hoping it turns out OK.
2002212158,512030,2018-12-06,5,Love this gravy. I always add a little garlic powder at the end.
2001981057,519167,2018-12-06,5,Made this recipe two days in a row because it was so good! I left out the water because my banana amount was closer to 2 cups and it was great
1052873,517769,2018-12-06,5,This was great! Very pungent but not too spicy. I made 1/2 recipe but had to use the full amount of stock. Great with rice and without.
2002357771,222684,2018-12-06,5,"A couple weeks ago my oven broke down so I dug my convection oven out of the garage and tried it with this salmon recipe. 5 minutes in and the house was filled with the most heavenly aroma! 20 minutes seem long to me so I stopped it at 15 just to check, the temp was fine but I let it finish anyway and it was delicious! I thought about possibly cutting back to 18 minutes but I ended up liking the crispy parts of the fish the best and it wasn't dry at all. I did leave out the dill because I didn't have any. Everything else, good as is, same temperature and time. Loved it!!!"
2002358053,68900,2018-12-06,5,Followed the very easy recipe. Delicious! Only yield 13 cookies. Guess I made them too big :(( Will try again!
969757,92193,2018-12-06,5,Thanks for posting! Nearly exactly like the Dad’s Cookies I grew up eating in Canada. Brings back so many fond memories!
2002356808,394031,2018-12-05,5,"This sauce is wonderful. I was a little hesitant because of multiple roasting steps and food processor, but it was worth it. I will be making this again."
2002356833,74080,2018-12-05,5,"Best corn syrup recipe I've found so far! I read the comments below, and what I think could fix the crystalizing problem is: When you add all your ingredients just squeeze half a lemon into the mix. That should help. If it doesn't, then I'm all out of ideas!"
2000498330,440425,2018-12-05,5,Mildly flavored soft textured bread. I used sharp cheddar and may seek a more aged cheddar or white cheddar. Still a very good bread. Used for sandwiches and toast.
2002357020,82303,2018-12-05,5,Delicious quick thick chocolate sauce with ingredients on hand! I have memorized this now so I can stir it up quickly. Thanks for a great recipe!
2002356776,25688,2018-12-05,4,"It's a good recipe, but I'd add one step. To make the mixing easier, heat the corn syrup up before mixing it in. Get it good around boiling point. It will be thinner and easier to incorporate."
2002357459,535853,2018-12-05,5,very dank
2002357452,535853,2018-12-05,1,too much butter if you ask me
1800181241,73825,2018-12-05,0,This is the very best carrot cake I have ever made. So moist. I would truly recommend it. Everyone that has tasted it loves it.
2002356752,128094,2018-12-05,0,"I also add, Doritos, Bugles, Cheese Nips, Cheese Bits, Cashews, Cheezies, a lot more Worcestershire, Cheerios and when they come out of the oven I stir in a lot of parmesan cheese. I have been making them for at least 15 years and give out containers full at Christmas to friends and family."
2002353550,50684,2018-12-05,0,"The recipe sounded correct, but I followed this exactly, chilled the dough &amp; all. The second day, I sliced them &amp; baked 1 cookie sheet full &amp; let them cool...They spread out &amp; were awful! Tasted like too much flour, &amp; I rolled them in red &amp; green colored sugar, too. Disappointed! My Mother's old recipe of rolled Sunset cookies are much better! I'll stick to tried &amp; true."
198154,187362,2018-12-05,4,"I had homemade pumpkin pur&eacute;e instead of canned, which has a much thinner consistency. I assumed my batter may be on the thin side because of this. However, the batter was very thick. I was tempted to add more liquid, but decided to attempt it as is. They were so thick that I was afraid they wouldn't cook through. I cooked them at a lower temperature so the outside wouldn't get done before the inside. They turned out fine, very thick and fluffy. It made eight very filling pancakes."
2002357495,313708,2018-12-05,4,Good pie overall. Would add more sugar next time it was a touch tart for my taste. Used all fresh berries and the flavor was lovely :) Also added some lemon zest for an extra kick.
2001291279,413497,2018-12-05,5,Still yummy!
2002180566,140268,2018-12-05,0,This is a dish that I have enjoyed at restaurants often becoming vegetarian. When I read the recipe I knew I could convert it using firm tofu. Well pressed tofu marinated for about 1 hour worked great. Everything else went together easily and was delicious.
226867,243363,2018-12-05,5,"This was such good chicken salad! I have never used canned chicken, but I sure will again. I had no lemon pepper, so I used Pennzey's Sunny Paris seasoning. Also used a little less mayo. Served it on spinach leaves with home-made garlic croutons. Made for your football win."
2002357452,535852,2018-12-05,5,very healthy
2002357229,401185,2018-12-05,0,UGGGGHHH just wasted 1lb of EXPENSIVE butter *8.97 a lb the recipe on this page FAILS to mention the 1 cup of caster sugar.....so furious
2002357025,264619,2018-12-05,5,I had this first at the village cafe and fell in love right away! First time having it was there. Came home and found the recepie on line. I’ve been making it now every year for about 8 years. My kids love it and are always asking me to make it. Only thing different I do is blend it just a little with an immersion blender and add a little cream. So yummy!!
2002356891,34657,2018-12-05,1,"It turned out like paste...way too thick. I added more beer to change the consistency but it still doesn't turn out well. The batter is pretty flavorless (I used Shiner Bock so it should've had a decent flavor), and it gets extremely soggy immediately. NOT good. I'm sad I wasted such beautiful shrimp on this recipe."

227652,140486,2018-12-05,5,This was incredibly simple and easy to put together. Thank you so much!
2002357394,67930,2018-12-05,5,These were surprisingly good. I made these over others because they had simpler ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly except I subbed in 1 cup of wheat flour for some of the white. Nice crispy exterior.
319738,154918,2018-12-05,4,"I made this with the added 1/4 cup sugar (as I couldn't find a box of sweet cornbread mix) and I think it was missing something. I will probably make this again, but maybe add onion as another reviewer suggested? Thanks for a nice side to our chili!"
2002260349,313157,2018-12-05,5,"Yum yum! I added a half cup of tomato sauce and 4 oz can of jalepenos to for more spice. Despite adding the tomato sauce I kept the diced tomatoes, it added diversity to the texture and a different flavor than just the sauce by itself."
2002356918,78194,2018-12-05,5,I love this recipe! I've been making it for years.. it is sooo good and easy to remember! I can just throw in some mayo and dash in the ingredients and it is perfect! Only changes I make is I add extra jalapenos and skip the sugar because I prefer it extra spicy!
2002357072,31629,2018-12-05,5,"My mom's friend, Maryann Fellows (nee Olsson), won a new kitchen from Pillsbury for developing this recipe and entering it into their contest in 1954. It says Robert as the entrant, but I'm sure back then she entered as Mrs. Robert Fellows. She was a native of Sweden who came to America in the late 1940s. Her original recipe calls for raspberry jam, but any jelly or preserve will be delicious I'm sure. We just always make it the way Mrs. Fellows did. I bet if she had access to lingonberry jam at the time, she might have considered using that as it is such a traditional Swedish flavor. These are so fast to make and fly off of the plate every time I cook them. Thank you Mrs. Fellows! We will always remember you for your delicious cookies."
2002356883,26110,2018-12-05,5,"I am a cook and I typically HATE baking. Decided on a whim to make biscuits since i had leftover buttermilk. These were so easy to make and perfect in every way. Crispy on the outside and soft, buttery, and flaky on the inside. I made one batch and went back to make 2 more (I was cooking for a crowd). Made 20 biscuits, for 12 people and there were no leftovers."
2002356966,261889,2018-12-05,2,"good cookies ,,,but !????next time i will reduce the sugar amount cuz to me they r very sweet before even add icing !!!!, and the baking soda,they came out very soft like cake,,,,thx for sharing"
2002356615,106395,2018-12-04,5,"This was delicious! Followed the recipe as stated, wouldn't change a thing! Thanks so much for sharing!"
2002356511,498738,2018-12-04,5,"I love these corn muffins. I've been making them for years and they are amazing. Here are my tweaks to make them a little more healthy: I use 6oz of butter instead of 8oz (we don't seem to notice the difference), and 5 T of honey instead of sugar."
2000498330,49474,2018-12-04,5,So delicious. Used good quality smoked turkey and Havarti cheese. The savory with just a touch of sweet definitely hits with me.
2002355951,309834,2018-12-04,5,"Great recipe! I did the Dutch oven/closed lid preparation. The first loaf was great, but wanted a crustier exterior so I baked the second loaf with a pan of water on the bottom of my oven to create steam. Better crust this time around - next time will keep the lid off to see if I can get it even crustier. But frankly, it’s delicious as is!!"
2002355792,473263,2018-12-04,4,Great recipe and really easy to make. This was a big hit with the kids as well. I added some cream cheese and reduced the butter. I'm pretty sure it's one of those recipes that doesn't need to be exact and will still come out great.
2002355997,168741,2018-12-04,3,"I thought this was really bad since I took a taste of the liquid right after putting it together, and then the finished dish right after completing. After 24 hours, it's not *as* bad. But, still tasting along the way, I added more mayo/salad dressing, mustard, and vinegar, and now 24 hours later it's okay, still not great. Hindsight being what it is, I'd cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup, increase the mustard just a little (maybe an extra tsp), and double the vinegar. And also increase the amount of potatoes that it dresses. I used a little more than 6 cups (well drained and cooled), and it's a smidgen watery using maybe 3/4 the dressing."
2002355891,134203,2018-12-04,1,"Came out completely dry and tasteless, and that's after turning it off 2 hours early. Potatoes were way too large and should have been cut at 1' cubes. Not enough broth for the volume of ingredients. Didn't even call for Worcestershire sauce. Awful recipe."
2002356287,533154,2018-12-04,0,I’ve tried just about every “brownie in a mug” recipe out there on a google search (at least 7-8 others!) and keep coming back to this one. It really is my favorite. I substitute the coconut oil for regular oil just because I don’t have any coconut oil in the house... and it turns out really good each time. Thanks for a keeper recipe!
2002355884,505062,2018-12-04,0,it looks bad and ugly
2002282011,2886,2018-12-04,0,Wonderful Banana Bread! I've made it several times since I read the recipe and the reviews are always the greatest!
126043,153129,2018-12-04,5,This is delicious. I made 25 whole pork tenderloins and used this sauce for my Granddaughters wedding. Many ingredients but well worth the time. I make a double batch and freeze it in quart jars so it's always available when we get a craving for really good pulled pork.
2002355988,142856,2018-12-04,4,I tweaked the recipe and used 3 cinnamon sticks and 8 cloves. It’s a middle ground between this and most other recipes. I also made my own contraption and used a fish turner since I’m in the US and no one sells sugar tongs. I used a clay pot because it retains heat very well and heats up evenly and mounted it on non flammable coasters (mine were marble). Then placed 2 candles on it. It worked perfectly.
377929,155323,2018-12-04,5,Absolutely delicious! Perfect blend of flavors! I used home roasted peppers. Thank you for sharing. This is going in to my &quot;recipes to impress&quot; box :)
400708,295216,2018-12-04,5,"Fast easy and delicious, and as a bonus even my picky hubby liked it. That makes it 5 stars in my book any day of the week"
2002276855,92021,2018-12-04,5,An excellent recipe. Plain simple and delicious especially if you add two or even three of the extra stir-ins.
2002356604,15286,2018-12-04,4,"Good recipe, however I seasoned the masa which I used already made Ramirez that's basically just corn and lime. I added a couple of cups of the red chili sauce that I made from this post along with the pork broth. It still wasn't enough seasoning for my taste so I added garlic powder, plenty of salt and pepper and a little chili powder. I like a fluffier masa once cooked so I added a couple of more teaspoons of baking powder. Turned out good. I made mild and hot. For the hot I divided half the meat mix and in the pan of the halved meat mix I put a little lard and 3 tablespoons of crushed pepper fried it a little to release the heat and mixed in with my pork. For a beginner I am almost willing to bet no one can tell the difference between mine and abuelitas ??. Just dont skimp on the seasoning and you will be fine. I'm in texas the tamales here have a red seasoned masa wrapping rather than plain Jane masa with broth. So go on your flavor taste."
2002355817,138369,2018-12-04,1,Save yourself some time. Dont even try this recipe. The toffee is grainy and the dry ingrediants outweigh the wet terribly. Dough is basically sand. Only tried the recipe because I thought it would be funny to see how bad things went. Worse than i could have ever anticipated.
1686076,269696,2018-12-04,5,"easy to put together, this soup pretty much takes care of itself. Some basic chopping, playing with seasoning and patience was all that was required. This soup could be used to clean out the fridge as the broth permeates everything with a smoky ham and bean flavor. Heaven on a cold winter's day."
2002356190,42976,2018-12-04,5,"I made this last night and brought it to my coworkers this morning. It's almost gone and its only 10:30am. They also requested I make it again this week, haha. SO good!"
2002189539,537076,2018-12-04,4,"Was tasty, hubby and daughter loved it, will probably use 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes and slightly less olives or chop them up finer - Thnk u for sharing"
2002356295,392356,2018-12-04,0,I line the baking sheet with foil for easy clean up. I also lay a piece of parchment paper on top to prevent grease from possibly splattering in my oven.
2002355845,46877,2018-12-04,4,Made this as lemon shortbread wedges by adding some lemon extract and covering with glaze. You can see some photos and the modified recipe in my blog: https://bulachki.com/lemon-shortbread/
2001297534,163690,2018-12-04,5,I made this as written. It was delicious. Thanks for sharing.
1686076,493561,2018-12-04,4,I am not a baker so this is about as adventurous as I get in this area. The recipe was clear and straight-forward and I followed it easily. The finished bread was light and moist. I would cut back on the sugar next time as I found it a little too sweet for our taste. It also didn't hold together as well as I might have hoped and I will have to examine things to know if that was due to some error on my part or just the nature of this cornbread.
2002355725,139668,2018-12-04,0,"these donuts are amazing very easy to make, very tasty and not too sweet. we used a teaspoon ice cream scoop to make donut holes."
198757,158248,2018-12-04,5,"Very delicious. To me, there was a little too much tarragon. I would try half as much next time. I used chicken stock."
2002355720,496614,2018-12-04,2,"Tried this recipe exactly as written. Didnt love it, was more like cornbread and sweet. Nothing like a biscuit. Probally wouldn't make again, the family wasnt pleased."
2002356060,474439,2018-12-04,1,Awful. Absolutely awful. Turned out gooey in the middle and tasted like buttery bread dough. Wouldn't suggest this recipe to anyone.
2002356120,502197,2018-12-04,5,This was a big hit for our office potluck luncheon! I even noticed folks eating it for breakfast the day after! Quick and easy to make - thanks for a new favorite!
2000308677,51104,2018-12-04,3,"The cookies are good, but they are crying for a depth of salt."
2002356640,16887,2018-12-04,0,"Though its not clear, i think this would work best if the onion was sliced into 1/4 inch slices prior to the flour and battering. (Obviously a lil teasing here, onion ring recipe is awesome). ;)"
2001362355,333618,2018-12-04,4,Flavor was great but only used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. They were a bit too mushy so think I will cut down to 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil next time. I enjoyed the sweet-salty combo with this recipe.
2002263230,292648,2018-12-03,5,This was a delicious appetizer. I served it with tortilla chips and everyone was raving about it. Fresh and flavorful. I didn't change a thing.
2002355690,19015,2018-12-03,5,Turned out very tasty. Hearty meal that is perfect for a cold night at home when comfort food is what you and your family want. I added half of an IPA to substitute for some of the water. I also added a little Maggi (Wurze) seasoning for a little extra flavor. The family loved it and wants it again soon.
2002355691,57685,2018-12-03,0,I do Not cook red meat well. This recipe was perfect. My entire family was shocked. Followed it exactly and it came out perfect!
2002355196,215414,2018-12-03,5,"I was looking for recipes for leftover cooked ground beef. I still forget I'm only cooking for two now. I noticed a review for under-cooked potatoes. I took the potatoes out of a box of scalloped mix instead. Layered on bottom and lightly sprinkled a very small amount of cheese and 1 cup of water over them. Cut meat into small squares and cooked 1/2 medium onion, 1 seeded and diced green pepper and only 2 garlic cloves (instead of 4) in olive oil. Then added seasoned salt &amp; black pepper and stirred with wooden spoon till onions translucent, Turned off. And for sauce mixed in bowl, soup with onion, half &amp; half (instead of light cream) sour cream, parmesan cheese and sm amount garlic salt (instead of garlic powder). Greased 13X9 baking dish with Crisco, layered potatoes on bottom sprinkled with small amount of cheese and 1 cup water, then soup mixture and sprinkled grated cheddar cheese on top of soup mixture, and then the beef. I also sprinkled beef with some cheese, as well. Baked 350 for 40 minutes. My husband and I loved it! Great combination and perfect potatoes. Just enough. I used what I had in the house and it turned out great!"
2002355360,48494,2018-12-03,5,"I’ve made this recipe 3 yrs in a row and they’ve always beeen a hit. But this year I was asked to make a separate batch for one of my guests who has to eat gluten free. With hesitancy I did so and you know what, none of my guests could tell the difference. They loved them! I used a generic gluten free flour and it worked. ??"
2002355244,368040,2018-12-03,5,"I did a recipe very similar to this this morning, delicious!"
1719632,67930,2018-12-03,4,The taste is wonderful! The batter was really thin so next time I'll cut down on the milk.
274666,201810,2018-12-03,5,Love this remake of the classic. Thanks for posting!
2002355069,295797,2018-12-03,5,I make these every year at Christmas time. I used the Nestle Mint/Dark Chocolate Chips. Nice recipe to include in a cookie exchange.
20622,1881,2018-12-03,5,"This cake was always a staple in my grandmothers pantry as well as any other pantry around. Moist and delicious, at times it had a light drizzle frosting but mostly it was plain. I still make it using my Nan's recipe and during the Christmas Season I add glaced Mixed fruit, Red and Green Cherries etc and of course I add a little Cheer-up ( Rum or Brandy), Makes a beautiful Fruit cake. I also make one for my friend using Craisins as she hates raisins... This is one of those cakes that stands the test of time and is always a favourite...I have made it in loaf pans as well as tube and bundt . Thank you for sharing your recipe..."
1803354076,17186,2018-12-03,5,This is the best recipe I've ever used for Mac and Cheese. It's now the ONLY recipe I'll ever use again!!
536962,122554,2018-12-03,5,I used macerated strawberries because that was what I was trying to use up. Other than that I did exactly what the recipe instructed. I put it in the oven for 40 minutes and forgot about it until the timer went off. It came out PERFECT. I love it. I could eat half the pan easily. I am going to try withe blueberries next.

I went ahead and made this recipe to the letter, in spite of my hesitation, and sure enough, it was a mess! Give this recipe a pass because there are a lot of better recipes out there."

2001566902,175221,2018-12-03,3,"It’s okay, I always make my own pie crust, and NEVER fry in oil, always beef tallow for sweets, lard works too, but tallow is scrumptious. Also when making your own pie crust ALWAYS use butter NEVER use shortening. :)"
1926335,246983,2018-12-03,5,One of my favorite deli's makes a sauerkraut soup and I love it. This was different than theirs but delicious.
2001238181,187652,2018-12-03,5,I have a very small pressure cooker and halved this recipe to fit. I made the soup with some minor changes out of necessity. Part way through I realized I did not have broth as I thought so just added water. Realizing it definitely needed something after tasting it I threw in one beef bouillon cube as it was all I had. It worked! Maybe it wasn't perfect but it was really good and I plan on making it more often and doing it right. I would highly recommend this for beginners like me.

173838,419868,2018-12-03,5,"This made a delicious dinner! The only differences I made were to use two tablespoons of butter with one tablespoon of grape seed oil for the scallops and add parmesan cheese when serving. Our scallops were especially juicy, so I didn't need to add the pasta water. Thank you for creating a wonderful recipe!"
2002355224,38806,2018-12-03,2,"I made these for a Christmas party. I thought they were going to be great but they weren’t a hit. Not at all. I think the filling may be better used on crescent roll dough or something else other than tortillas. Anyway, I can only hope my husband will like them or they are bound for the garbage."
2001998549,483664,2018-12-02,5,"Made this twice with 8 thighs and it is wonderful!!!! Make and enjoy! Have been following Jacques Pepin for 40 years, and he has NEVER failed me. Katie"

2002354675,48663,2018-12-02,5,"I didn't put in the extra onion; however, I ground up 1/2 Cup of Walnuts and put in I teaspoon of cinnamon, along with the salsa, soy sauce, and oatmeal...I always experiment by adding different herbs and spices."
2002354484,80156,2018-12-02,5,"I did make a few changes to the recipe, but my cookies turned out amazing! I added 2 more tbsp of butter, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and one more egg. These were soft and sweet, with just enough spice, I don’t like a very spicy cookie though. They also held up very well when decorating. Will be making another batch today!"
2002354028,206184,2018-12-02,5,"Made a small batch for my husband to try, afterwards he requested a second batch. I added onion to the second batch. I didnt have the pepper flakes on hand and it still turned out really good. I also just used the minced garlic in the jar not fresh and was still tasty. I Will definately add this to my favorite dishes. Thanks!"
2002354564,32614,2018-12-02,5,Just made these using 1/3 cup oil. Used a 1/2 tbls cookie scoop and dropped them right into the powdered sugar then rolled them. Came out perfectly. Baked at 375 for 9min.
2002354850,150473,2018-12-02,4,"Tried this recipe to give to a vegan friend. Followed the recipe exactly except added vegan dark chocolate chunks and didn't add walnuts. When it came out of the oven, I thought it was way too bitter tasting, so made a quick icing of powdered sugar. It tastes way better after having it in the fridge over night. Would definitely recommend adding some kind of frosting on top or else it will be way too bitter!"
2002354107,207381,2018-12-02,0,Made this recipe recently as both muffins and as a cake. It was amazing!! I can highly recommend. It stays moist and does not dry out at all. Great with or without icing. This will definitely be added to my favourites list.
2002354798,144748,2018-12-02,4,"Coming from the Dutch Indonesian family, you need 4 sticks of butter instead of the 2 this recipe calls for- it’s too dry without the full pound of butter! Good luck!"
2002354775,412496,2018-12-02,0,I think you need to add some butter to replace the milkfat missing from the powdered milk. Other similar recipes I've seen call for 3 Tbsp of melted unsalted butter.
2002354593,31750,2018-12-02,5,This recipe is perfection! Definitely a keeper
2000080217,69240,2018-12-02,0,"Even better, roast the broccoli as described, make a hollandaise sauce and add a tablespoon of ranch dressing to the hollandaise before pouring it over broccoli."

2778043,93256,2018-12-02,5,FINALLY! I have finally found the perfect white bread recipe. I can't believe how soft &amp; moist my bread came out with a light flaky crust. Thank you (note: the only tweak I made was changed to 3 Tbsp of honey after reading some of the reviews. It didn't make the bread sweet....just absolutely perfect)
2001995748,71849,2018-12-02,4,"Turned out well. I used a little over a cup of flour before they got too dry, I’d suggest more like 1/2-3/4 C, start low and add slowly, stopping when it starts to crumble. Also added milk, eyed it but I’d say 1/4 C or so. Cream your butter with your sugars, drop the salt to 1/2 tsp. Family liked it though, good recipe when you realize you don’t have eggs!"
198154,289268,2018-12-02,5,"I had to make small adjustments according to what I had on hand. I used a roll of vegetaria ground sausage that I cooked in the first step and then added back to the pot at the very end with the lemon. I had a large bunch of kale, one large can of beans, baby carrots (cut) and jarred mince garlic. Even with these changes, the soup turned out fantastic. Even DH, who made a face when I told him what was for dinner, enjoyed it."
2002272396,187519,2018-12-02,0,This turned out to be the best pizza crust I've ever made....must of messed up somewhere ;-) I baked it at 500 on a parchment paper on top of a screen then removed it (the paper) after 10 mins or so and cooked until lovable on top. And the dough didn't spring back for the first time. Let the dough sit for 1/2 hour. Didn't use any extra flour. Glad I found this.....thanks.
2002354324,15195,2018-12-02,5,We loved this one Mark! My only changes were a bit of chopped onion and some cumin. (seemed like a Tex-Mex kind of recipe to me). Go to the head of the class dude!
2001848316,439708,2018-12-02,1,"I just read &quot;Sugar Cookie Murder&quot; by Joanne Fluke, published in 2004. This is her recipe word for word - copy &amp; paste. Who is this RandiDB? Someone of pretty low character, I guess, loading recipes as her own."
2001055808,442092,2018-12-02,5,"I found this recipe when I was looking for a crispy chocolate cookie recipe that I could modify with orange. This was amazing, so I can only imagine that the original recipe would be great as written. I added 1 teaspoon of orange extract. I would have added a bit of orange zest if I had it but I didn't, and they were still amazing. I did the first batch plain, the second batch I sprinkled sugar on top, and the third batch I flattened the slightly and then sprinkled sugar on top. The third batch was the best, to me, but they were all great. I will use a little more orange next time but I am making these next week for a cookie swap. Delicious!"
2001334849,101954,2018-12-02,5,"Awesome recipe! Use half dark and half light corn syrup, perfection."

2002354025,259573,2018-12-02,0,At 69 I've made a few hard boiled eggs over the years. It has always been a pain peeling them. I took your advice and added salt and vinegar to the water. I am shocked. I have never had shell literally fall off the egg! First one end then the other. Off in 2 pieces! Amazing. Thanks.
2818618,318626,2018-12-02,5,"Yes, yes and yes! You definitely want to make this."
2002354009,289878,2018-12-02,5,Wow this was a delish recipe! I made it for my husband and he said it was the best kabsa hes ever had! I also cut down the water to 3 cups(canned tomatoes also have juices). And I used the same recipe for lamb kabsa. Perfect!
2001865110,187731,2018-12-02,4,I made this with Frank's Hot Sauce and it was good but not great. I am going to make it again with the Sweet Tai Chili Sauce as the recipe recommends. I put over jasmine rice I made in my One Pot. I won't leave off the scallions next time either. The cornstarch was a very light coating and I thought it would be heavier. Overall... good recipe.
2002354802,102677,2018-12-02,5,"Delicious! Since in cooked them for myself, I quartered the recipe and used Gruyere cheese. Very nice flavor and no bitterness! Thank you for the recipe!"
2002354493,284040,2018-12-02,5,So happy with the outcome! Will definitely have these more often during my pregnancy!!
2002323023,73937,2018-12-02,5,"My sauce is very similar to this recipe except that I use ground beef, pork and veal in my meatballs along with the other ingredients. I have used crushed tomatoes in my sauce which saves chopping the tomatoes. They cook down nicely. This recipe sounds delicious. I will probably die with a meatball and some sauce in my mouth!!!"
665790,467871,2018-12-02,5,"After reading all of the reviews, I decided to make these just as the recipe was written. They came out great! Fluffy and risen, not flat as some people's had. These are very much like Red Lobster biscuits. As a side note, I did all my mise en plas earlier in the day so all of my ingredients besides the cheese were at room temperature when I prepared these. Maybe that is the difference between them coming out flat vs. risen? I will definitely be keeping these in my recipe rotation."
2002078642,2886,2018-12-02,5,"Oh my goodness is this ever good! So easy to make, too. I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 tsp vanilla and added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Super delish thank you for this awesome recipe!"
2001677368,22782,2018-12-02,5,This is the best sauce you will ever make! It's absolutely perfect!
2002353868,425348,2018-12-02,5,"I just made this for dinner, using 16 ounces of Sprite as I did not have Apple Cider and although they say Alcohol cooks out I do not use any of it in my cooking. Instructions very easy to follow and it turned out absolutely delicious. So easy and quick to prepare."
2000736218,10885,2018-12-02,3,Soaked my beans all night and followed instructions. I simmered for an hour... Beans are still hard 5 hours later still simmering. Help!!
2002353988,344022,2018-12-02,4,"It sounded so good when I heard ‘cream cheese quiche’ and this was the first recipe that popped up. I made it today *yum* I didn’t have pimento but popped in some chopped marinated olives instead. I also put a little maasdam cheese on top (the more cheese the merrier, right?). I think it would be amazing with smoked salmon, that’s what I’ll do next time :)"
2001510827,345270,2018-12-01,0,"My wife followed this recipe to the letter. In doing so it burned up her brand new cast iron 7 1/2 qt Lodge kettle, which was a 45th anniversary present. These things are very expensive. We are exceedingly unhappy. So to whoever tries this recipe be very careful."
2002353209,389334,2018-12-01,5,"This is the recipe from Purple Pig in Chicago, which is the best marrow anywhere. The salad cuts through the fat and sea salt is a necessity."
10997,85166,2018-12-01,5,"Good flavor and easy to make with ingredients on hand or readily available. I added a bit of minced celery, green onion and red pepper for some crunch, color and fresh flavor. I also used vegan mayo - Hellman's vegan sandwich spread as one of the family has an egg allergy. Family enjoyed this dish. I will be making this again as a quick and economical meal. Thank you for sharing."

2002352928,2677,2018-12-01,0,"I was a little worried when these biscuits didn't rise as much to my liking prior to baking, but they came out perfect, and the flavor was divine. So homey....so old school. Had them slathered with butter and with chicken pot pie, in the crock pot without the crust. I will definitely keep this recipe and use it often. It's so easy, and like the other reviews, it turns out just perfect. You really must try this recipe. You won't be disappointed."
2001158027,46877,2018-12-01,5,"Only recipe I use. I do not use vanilla and use unsalted butter and add a pinch of salt to flour. I roll into walnut size balls, flatten slightly with fork, and sprinkle with coloured sugar before baking @ 325 for 15 mins. Shortbread is always better when aged so I refrigerate cooled cookies in an air tight container after baking and attempt to wait for the magic to happen. I have kept shortbread if well hidden for up to a month."
2002353692,456285,2018-12-01,5,Great recipe! Love the mayo and onions
2177426,100480,2018-12-01,5,"Super easy and very good. Made with apples, butterscotch (sugar-free) pudding mix. Made with no pie crust! like a very tasty apple crisp. Replaced the white sugar with Splenda but kept the brown sugar for flavor."
2001022455,340111,2018-12-01,0,"This is a very rewarding loaf, spelt flour has a weaker gluten than wheat, so an expert baker I consulted suggested it can be enhanced with a teaspoon or so of fresh lemon juice in the water which I always test for temperature 110 F. We also use the shortest setting for 1 1/2 pound loaf so as not to overwork it. In our research, we found that this ancient grain has not been modified, and is always minimally processed, this is possibly why those with wheat sensitivity or who are prone to inflammation tolerate it better."
2002353742,154740,2018-12-01,5,"OMG It's SO GOOD!!! It's after Thanksgiving. I crammed two carcasses into my big crock pot, picked out the bones and gook and have a big bowl of stock, another of shredded turkey. I'm trying to use stuff up in the fridge but really don't want a pot of turkey soup so I used this recipe as an outline and I subbed out a few things. 1. The rice I made with turkey stock instead of water. 2. Shredded turkey instead of ground. 3. I had 2 nearly full 16 oz containers, 1 of fresh hot salsa, the other bruschetta. They sell these in the produce section. Top Crop is the name and I love their fresh regular salsa but they had been out. I left out all the diced tomato and onion and layered these in instead! 4. I had about 16 oz of vegetable juice (like V8) no one was drinking so used that instead of 2/3 of the sauce with one 8 oz can of tomato sauce. This came out so good! Some heat from the salsa but yet the sweet of the brown sugar shines through! My honey ate 2 giant bowls and I ate one and I would've ate more if I could! Definitely will be keeping this as the go-to after Thanksgiving treat and will make it anytime I can! Might have chicken, might have sausage! Be adventurous!"
2002353177,397836,2018-12-01,0,"I made this tonight to use up some green onions. I made one with gluten-free flour (for me) and one with with ordinary flour, as per the recipe. Also added chia seeds (pre-soaked), some diced feta cheese and chopped fresh rosemary. Both doughs were very sticky and not exactly easy to 'knead' -- so I was pleasantly surprised to see how much they each rose. Both look and smell amazing, and the gluten-free one has passed the taste test (the other one will have to wait for others to try)! Excellent and nicely adaptable recipe."
2002353444,95220,2018-12-01,5,"I was introduced to these about 8 or 10 years ago and have been making them since at Christmas time. To save time opening the rollos get the boxes with 36 rolls of eight, open eight at a time. I get them at Sam’s Club."
2001032479,399612,2018-12-01,5,"Did what the recipe called for, except I had a jar of gravy (1-1/2 cups) bought from the store, and created 3 cups chicken broth using dry bullion. This caused the dish to be too salty, my fault. I doubled the shredded turkey and that was great. I did not have a tight fitting lid to fit my cast iron skillet, and the dumplings did lift the lid. But it was okay, I just turned up the heat to medium for an additional 5 minutes and it came out great. The family agreed it tasted just like a chicken pot pie, yum!"
2349753,533538,2018-12-01,5,"A beautiful, rustic loaf, with a great crust. We baked it in an enameled, cast iron pot, and followed the recipe as written. Success."

2002179259,120517,2018-12-01,1,"We're not picky eaters but this was not good. Nobody liked it. I wouldn't even try to make changes to make it better, it just wasn't worth it."
2002353118,205890,2018-12-01,5,Delicious I wouldn't change a thing thank you
2002353561,372087,2018-12-01,5,I made these cookies at home and they turned out perfect. The only thing I didn't do was add all the butter I used one stick and just softened it up for 20 seconds in the microwave. It turned out a success!
2002353582,264131,2018-12-01,5,I just used this recipe for the first time with my thanksgiving turkey in my oil less turkey fryer. I changed absolutely nothing with this recipe and that bad boy was DELICIOUS!! I was so impressed I am using it again tonight in my roaster oven on leg quarters. Thanks for sharing this recipe!
2002353132,83890,2018-12-01,0,"Well; I’ve been in Mexico for 19 years and a Chef for much longer and this is not authentic sorry to say. Cilantro is used to finish the preparation but Hierbabuena/Menta=Spearmint/Mint which is the most common mint sold in groceries/markets is integrated into the mixture and the broth. As for what’s in the broth; potatoes? Usually calabaza verde / zucchini- thick cut, zanahoria / carrots- thick cut, green beans etc... potatoes cloud the broth and add a double starch. Anyway; the mint is a must and you will find it to be a much more vibrant satisfying bowl of sopa!"
2001175184,427536,2018-12-01,4,"I used two tablespoons butter instead of teaspoons, whole milk and shaved parm (because that's what I had on hand.) The parm was salty enough that I didn't need to add any salt. I love a simple, quick recipe that you can make a few modifications to without ruining it!"
2002353792,211485,2018-12-01,4,"Let me first say that this sauce cannot survive for 20 minutes at medium heat, at least at my stage. Having reduced it to a burned thick mess the first time I made this, I watched it closely and kept adding water. I don't know about the cooking time also. I only cook for one, so I halve recipes for four and use only one breast, and just have extra sauce.. I found it very tasty but you got to watch reducing the sauce if you are going to fry it. I really had to add a lot of water."
2002353010,422866,2018-12-01,0,"11/30/18 Tried this recipe for first time! My family loved it. I can never fry a chop without it being leather tough, but I followed this recipe to the letter and they were delicious! THANKS! !"

The soaking of the raisins is key!!! Now, I have to admit, I did add a couple dashes of nutmeg... but I’ll just keep that as my little secret ingredient... lol... even the kids from the higher grades came back to get more! By the way, I’ve been making cookies for years.... chocolate chip, sugar, oatmeal..... and these are the ones everyone wants!!!!"

1608048,300049,2018-11-30,2,"I didn’t like these at all. I always make my mashed potatoes with just butter and they turn out great, but I thought this sounded interesting. The potatoes turned out really gummy with a glue like texture."
2002352145,420762,2018-11-30,4,"We enjoyed this recipe...added a couple of teaspoons of siracha and a teaspoon or so of sesame oil to meat mixture before stuffing.

2001487430,412073,2018-11-30,5,This is a very good 13 bean soup recipe.....I had never added carrots and celery before but gives it even more flavor.....I had sweet basil out of my garden and also added one jalapeno pepper with only half the seeds as mine from garden were especially hot this year and I like a little extra kick.....I had a ham hock left over from Thanksgiving so used that for even more flavor.....I also added some homemade chicken broth and some beef broth as well...I will definitely use this recipe again and again....thanks for sharing.....
2002352139,496992,2018-11-30,1,Horrible!!!! Recipe calls to cook in a 9x9 pan but there was barely enough mix to cover a 8x8 pan they came out paper thin and tasted nasty. You would literally have to triple this recipe to make a halfway thick brownie in a 8x8 pan only problem with that is it would still not taste good. What a waste of ingredients.
2002352863,236964,2018-11-30,5,"I live at at 6200 ft and have had some success and some failures with my bread machine, they recipe turned out well and was tasty."
2002352649,77201,2018-11-30,5,"Absolutely delicious! I followed suggestions and really cut back on the butter (I used 3 T.), and didn’t precook the squash. My husband complimented it two days in a row, something he never does! I froze half of it for later enjoyment, and I’m so glad I did. This is a definite keeper."
2002352528,294196,2018-11-30,5,"Omg! Made this last night. Followed recipe to a T, and it came out perfect. Used a smaller rump roast though. Family ate it up. No left overs on this one. Will be making again."
2001552506,281914,2018-11-30,5,Delicious and easy. My first time cooking turnips and rutabaga!
2002188437,97312,2018-11-30,5,"I love this recipe. It can be modified in various ways, just keep the wet and dry ingredients in the approximate same proportion. One cookie will satisfy my hunger and sugar craving for several hours. I double the recipe because these cookies freeze well and I always have them on hand when needed. I always add about 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/3 cup nuts to increase the protein amount. I have also substituted pumpkin puree for the bananas and used pumpkin pie spice for seasoning as well as adding peanut butter and chopped nuts. Some of my friends like the pumpkin cookies better than the banana cookies. I like both and this gives me some flexibility as I get bored with eating the same foods over and over again. I always keep this cookies on hand to curb my hunger pains!"
2002352313,119611,2018-11-30,4,"The flavor is great, but very dry."
2002352332,2886,2018-11-30,5,"Delicious exactly as written... no tweaking needed! I followed this recipe exactly (including the optional 4th banana and vanilla extract) and it came out perfect! I did have to cook it about 15-20 minutes extra (maybe because of the extra banana?), but it really is the best banana bread I’ve ever had! I’m giving it to my grandma tomorrow and I know she will love it!"
2002348091,91592,2018-11-30,5,"This recipe is identical to one published in the New York Times, which must be the newspaper Sudie is referring to, credited to Mark Bittman. He says it's Manchurian in origin. Many of their readers commented that it tasted only like a ketchup sauce, and rather unappealing. Apparently it's very necessary to cook the ketchup as long as it takes to turn brown, sort of starting to caramelize. I plan to make this tonight, as a break from the Thanksgiving turkey!"
384918,320845,2018-11-30,5,This is quite good. Satisfying and flavorful.
2002352487,66538,2018-11-30,5,"Made a couple of changes... I used hot Italian sausage, added a pound of browned ground hot Italian sausage and a 15 oz can of Italian diced tomatoes which removes the need for the Italian seasoning/oregano. This is one of my favorites and it’s FANTASTIC!"
266635,533821,2018-11-30,5,"Easy to make and very rich -- a great treat for chocolate lovers. I had intended to make this for my grandkids for Thanksgiving, but wasn't able to. So now it will be just me and DH. : )"
767703,395966,2018-11-29,5,excellent bread 2 lb loaf
2002351842,104852,2018-11-29,5,"I absolutely love these cookies! I make several batches every Christmas. Instead of lemon extract, I use fresh lemon juice and zest for the dough and fresh lemon juice for the icing. They turn out perfect every single time."
2123645,236543,2018-11-29,3,"These are OK. They taste a lot like lemon cake, just in a different form. I didn't get much of the cheesecake flavor. Very easy to make though, and a nice presentation."
2123645,109750,2018-11-29,4,"Really good! Served this over rice with scallions sprinkled on top. I used chicken breasts, which was a little dry, but very tender. Great recipe to make some additions to, such as pineapple and bell peppers."
2002351406,397515,2018-11-29,5,"Made it and love it, I had this Jus before and it drove me crazy trying to replicate it and this has done it! Thanks"
2001915095,395954,2018-11-29,5,I LOVE this banana bread recipe! Was looking for one like my grandmas. And then there was you! Very moist and darker then traditional recipes. As close as I'm gone get! THANKS! Amy
2000632687,54269,2018-11-29,1,"Omgosh. This was bad. My white cake mixes turned brown like a spice cake. I made one, ugly. Made a second one, same. Made a third and a fourth, same thing. Taste was fair, color was horrible. Ruined 4 mixes. Followed directions each time, same results. White mix, added white extender, white while mixing, turned brownish while baking. Any answers to what happened??"
2123645,252773,2018-11-29,4,Really good comfort food!
2002351295,320488,2018-11-29,5,Delicious!! I quadrupled the recipe which filled a casserole dish and gave us leftovers to enjoy later. My husband and I both had seconds and my children enjoyed it too. We can’t have cow dairy so I used goat butter and goat milk and goat cheddar as well as goat mozzarella because I didn’t have enough if the cheddar. I cooked two diced sweet potatoes with the millet and used chicken broth instead of water which I do when I cook all of grains. I cooked some ground chicken separately and threw in some frozen spinach at the end and mixed everything together before putting it in the casserole dish. Such a yummy meal!
2002351458,80156,2018-11-29,3,Honestly it’s probably something I did. I followed the directions. They turned out awful. Very crumbly and impossible to roll. So probably my fault. They taste okay?
2002350384,51104,2018-11-29,5,"These were too good, oh no! The recipe was spot on, even the part about not over baking them... I did one batch for 16 minutes as a test, and they came out much crunchier... the 15 min bake time was perfect for chewy cookies, and don't be afraid if they look under done. Also, I made a bunch of substitutions which did not impact them in any noticeable way. I used Earth Balance (nondairy) instead of butter, I ran out of baking soda, so I used baking powder, also the PB... I know natural peanut butters are too crumbly for a cookie recipe, but I am not into conventional foods... Santa Cruz organics creamy PB was perfection for this recipe. I also liked how many batches this recipe makes!! We had plenty to eat, share and even freeze for cookies on the fly... I froze my extra dough, unbaked on a cookie sheet, then transferred to a plastic bag (so that they don't freeze together in a big lump) and future self looks forward to them-THANKS!!"
2001833357,36984,2018-11-29,0,"Super yummy. It was hard for me to try another stew recipe after cooking my grandmother's recipe my entire life. This is so much better. My husband slurped up bowl after bowl. I doubled the recipe. I added a few cloves of fresh garlic. Finally, I heated batches up at a time adding frozen peas, corn, and string beans. Helped thicken it up and added crunch and more flavor profile. Gravy is delicious."
2002352020,117532,2018-11-29,5,"The crust was perfect, not too crispy or too chewy! I doubled the recipe and made two pizzas so I can have leftovers and also please the picky eaters. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe :)"
2002351773,167509,2018-11-29,0,I've been making the All Bran muffins for over 40 years. Adding 2 cups of dates and a cup of walnuts make these fabulous.
266635,409780,2018-11-29,5,"Made this shake for breakfast this morning - enjoyed the combination of the banana and the peanut butter. Left out the extract and used additional banana to thicken it up. I used yogurt vs. the ice cream as I didn't have it on hand and although the shake was not as thick as it would have been, it was very creamy and it had a great taste."
2002351275,312980,2018-11-29,0,"Had more than a few of these at Dirty Joe's back in the day. Good drink. Good times. I guess Dirty Joe;s is gone, but at least the drink can still be had. Thanks Laurita"
2002351843,390340,2018-11-29,0,"Cathy Haber's, of Aloha Angel Cafe, recipe is excellent isn't it! I've been making this recipe for about 10 years and it's a highly requested recipe!"
2002305302,42780,2018-11-29,5,Omg...ive been looking for a recipe like this for years. Added Mrs Dash..garlic powder as seasoning. Made cod...shrimp and onion rings with the first batch. It was beyond my expectations. Thankyou!!!!
2002351298,119152,2018-11-29,5,"Only cooked 6 hrs on high, added 1/2 cup more water, delicious!"
2000794713,529558,2018-11-29,5,"I made this for the first time last year. It was a hit with everyone. People who hate fruitcake love this. I called it Christmas cake, lol. It disappeared so quickly, that this year I made two. The hardest part is waiting to eat it while it soaks up all that lovely bourbon."
2002351267,396895,2018-11-29,0,"Not sure why but I followed this recipe step by step, I had it in oven for 40 minutes let it stand for 10 minutes and it was runny like water and the bottom didn’t cook at all it was still batter. I put it on another 40 minutes but still the same result. Was so disappointed I might try again. Oven isn’t fan forced but shouldn’t make a difference."
1930519,126997,2018-11-29,5,"I've been making these for a few years now. Great right from the oven or reheated from frozen. Don't know if it's my oven or my 4,000 ft. altitude, but I always have to keep them in the oven double the time the recipe calls for. This is such a versatile recipe and it comes together so quickly."
2123645,55796,2018-11-29,4,Very tasty soup! I used fresh carrots. I think this would be good with some pasta added.
2002351508,20431,2018-11-29,5,super yummy. Have made a few batches (no raisins). Will make again and again.
2002352056,462313,2018-11-29,5,The sauce is crazy good! I also use it on boneless skinless chicken thighs and serve it over rice and stir fried veggies. Yum!
7173268,32844,2018-11-29,5,SO EASY! Great warm comfort food on a cold winter night. I used salsicca for my husband's and vegetarian field roast sausage for myself - we both enjoyed it!
2002351253,82934,2018-11-28,5,This was really good and great instructions. I didn't have enough cayenne so I used a half teaspoon of shrimp boil seasoning I had. Make sure to bring to a boil so the roux doesn't separate. Thanks for the recipe!
2002350785,70165,2018-11-28,5,"Made this first time last night. Awesome recipe!!! It was light and airy and super crunchy. A definite do-over. I pre-baked the crust at 500 degrees for 7 minutes on a preheated, upside down cookie sheet, then cooked with toppings for another 8 minutes. Perfectamundo!!!"
646615,115086,2018-11-28,0,"Delicious and easy. Great way to use up left over turkey. I saut&eacute;ed chopped celery, fresh carrots and regular onions and after adding flour and cayenne, transferred to a bowl. Then cooked noodles in Chix stock, added turkey &amp; veggie mixture back in, then brought to boil to thicken. Then added milk but did not boil. Go easy on cayenne; you don't want it spicy, but it gives it a warmth that adds substance."
2002350668,80156,2018-11-28,4,"To hard, even at minimum cook time; a thicker roll is better, These are non sweet, great if decorating but as is plain.. not a kid favorite, I just rolled in extra brown sugar on top, gives it a nice glaze.,"
2002350546,80156,2018-11-28,5,To speed up the resting t in me I put a bowl of water in the microwave and let it create steam. Then set my dough in their with the steaming bowl and shut the door for 30 minutes. I had also added a litte yeast 1tsp and no baking powder. The dough was nice and airy and was not sticking to my hands at all like it has in the past. I also added 2 cups flour and 1 cup lupin flour. I have accidentally eaten 7 tonight. If I had no shame I would eat them all before sunrise.
400708,49497,2018-11-28,5,"Made these for Thanksgiving and looked so cute. The marbling worked best on the green, the red just kind of dyed the whole egg red with no marbling effect. The flavor on the eggs didn't change at all but sure looked fun."
2002350421,196153,2018-11-28,1,"Horrible. Part of the potatoes were crunchy and brown, and when mashed they caused lumps. I only used 1 stick of butter, since I never use two when making them on the stove. I used 2 tsp. salt, and even that was too much. And I only used two splashes of milk; otherwise, they would have turned into potato soup. I will not make these again. I will make them on the stove top and put them in the crock pot to keep warm, which is what I should have done in the first place. Very disappointed."
2002202130,296064,2018-11-28,0,Could you update ingredients to include pine nuts? I always copy the ingredients when I grocery shop and always forget to buy them because they are not listed I think it would be good to mention in the instructions to toast the as well.
2002350527,399162,2018-11-28,0,Did not like the flavor... Also meatloaf was a bit dry. Followed recipe but included sauteed onions and substituted ketchup for bbq sauce. Going back to my tried and true recipe.
2002350586,519547,2018-11-28,2,"I made these today, they smelled incredible, texture was fantastic BUT they were not sweet enough at all.. the flavor of the almond and butter overpowered the sweet aspect and they tasted bitter almost. I would suggest adding more stevia and possibly chocolate chips or spices to mask that weird bitter taste."
2002350600,88800,2018-11-28,0,this was simple ....i added 1 container of cool whip and made a Reese cake for my nephew...crushed some reese cups and sprinkled over the icing...everyone loved the cake..thanks
2099206,422677,2018-11-28,5,I have made this multiple times and been very pleased. The taste is the rich flavor of the shrimp in lobster sauce of our favorite restaurant from years ago and not the bland &quot;egg-white&quot; sauce available in many restaurants today. Takes a little time in prep but comes together quickly when cooking. Delicious!
2001552506,507383,2018-11-28,5,Very good! unfortunately my grocery store didn't have kabocha so I substituted acorn and coated the inside with a bit of honey to make up for lost sweetness. Would recommend two acorn squashes if you do this since they're smaller.
2002351036,17210,2018-11-28,4,"It’s a good basic recipe but I would definitely recommend using chicken stock instead of water. I also added a small can of tomato paste, two cloves of garlic and a touch of Cayanne pepper If you like a little heat."
2002350406,10744,2018-11-28,0,"I have made this several times now, but I add sage, celery salt, poultry seasoning to the mixture. After the crust is in place, I'll place slices of butter in scattered spots and put additional seasoning on the butter pats. It just gives the crust a more savory and buttery taste!"
2002298190,350443,2018-11-28,0,Three measuring cups of flour is way off but 24 weighed ounces of flour is about right.
2002351023,387062,2018-11-28,0,This truly is the BEST jerky recipe we've tried. My husband is an avid hunter so we've made a lot of jerky over the years. We save the marinade and add it to our ground meat for Teriyaki burgers
2002350446,392763,2018-11-28,5,My boyfriend upon seeing his plate said “There’s not even any meat in it.” And then proceeded to eat 2 helpings. Approved by the carnivore himself. Will definitely be a staple in our house from now on.
2002350439,388951,2018-11-28,0,Stop what you are doing and make this bread right now. I baked it in a preheated Dutch oven and it is fantastic. Thanks
2002350639,472957,2018-11-28,5,This recipe is absolutely perfect. I love making it. So easy. So delicious. So much healthier &amp; tastier than store bought granola. I’ve also used maple syrup instead of honey. Doesn’t clump together with maple syrup but still tastes great.
2002350440,163760,2018-11-28,5,This is the best recipe and the one I have used for years. The recipe says the oven temp is 205. I believe it's supposed to be 250.
2002204787,66409,2018-11-28,5,"Great basic recipe, my tweeks are as follows Coarsely grated the butter (thanks to Martha Stewart) 3/4 cup cream instead of 1/3 milk 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/4 3/4 cup dried cherries chopped in half 3/4 cup white chocolate chips And the final touch was to freeze the baking pan with cut dough for 10 min before baking. A trick picked up somewhere, helps make them flakier. Something about refreezing the butter I think. Also if you fear you will overwork the dough and melt the butter when you cut the butter in, freeze the flour mixture first, keeps heat from affecting things. Who here remembered mom keeping flour in the fridge? It's a biscuit thing. Milk wash with coarse lavender sugar on top before baking"
2002324575,98934,2018-11-28,5,This has always been one of our family's favorite! Thanks for posting the recipe. My son in law who is from the UK loves it too.
2000778842,326407,2018-11-28,2,"I made this with tofu. It was edible, however it didn't have the rich peanut flavor I experience when I have this dish at Thai restaurants. I cut the fish sauce in half. Alas, fish sauce alone is not sufficient to create an authentic Thai dish. Deleting this from my bookmarks and off to explore other recipes."
2002350666,82945,2018-11-28,5,"I just came across an awesome recipe and have made it twice now. So simple and easy!!! I was planning to make a few as gifts for Christmas this year. Do sugar cookies keep and freeze well? How long can you keep them frozen and once defrosted and decorated with sugar icing, how long does it keep?"
2001274574,439069,2018-11-28,5,"This was really delicious. I did everything as called for, but I didn't melt the butter, just spread it on the squash and I didn't put it on broil, I just heated it at 400 for another 5 min. Turned out delish! Thanks!"
2002159896,361754,2018-11-28,5,‘I use this recipe always. I use cold butter instead of shortening. My favourite biscuit recipe. Great with strawberries and whip cream. I don’t use the jam just the biscuit
2002350589,37183,2018-11-28,0,"I found my own dressing to be quite sharp, having to add a lot (4 Tbsp) sugar and a lot more honey mustard. I also added a dash of worstershire sauce and soy seasoning sauce to take the edge off the sharpness. It's worth playing around with the flavours until you get something you like. I put everything in a blender to make the adjustments easy. Overall, a lovely and versatile dressing. Nice to have on hand as a quick and easy dressing that complements a wide variety of salads :)!"
2001297534,59793,2018-11-28,5,Other than using half &amp; half instead of light cream I made this recipe as written. It was easy to put together and had a lot of flavor. It was a big hit with every one in this household. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.
2002350307,410185,2018-11-27,5,Delicious! Even my picky husband loved it. Will definitely make again.
2002279665,218770,2018-11-27,1,"I made this just as written but only had a 9” pan so it didn’t rise much, in fact it looked like a large flat cookie! This was one of the worst recipes I’ve tried for cornbread. I’ve tried so many and have not succeeded in making cornbread at all. I don’t own a black iron pan and although I grew up having one in the family, I can’t fathom using a pan that isn’t supposed to be washed out. The cornbread was severely lacking in taste. The best I’ve tasted is Marie Callendars out of California but I’m in Florida now. So, my search continues for the best tasting CB."
2002349864,9054,2018-11-27,5,I loved these as a kid and learned to make them by watching my mom. The amount of flour and eggs to use depends on how creamy or chunky your potato’s are.
198154,35625,2018-11-27,4,"I used a garlic and black bean hummus. I also used dried parsley and reduced fat feta, as that is what I had on hand. Turn out great. DH suggested making it for New Years Eve, as we have several dietary restrictions in our family and this is something we all can eat."
2002349307,173879,2018-11-27,1,"The measurements were WAY off and I wasn't happy about wasting $ because of it. At one point it called for two cans of tomato sauce that are 5.75ML in size. Well that equals .19 of an OZ then later it tells me to use the entire tub of ricotta on the bottom layer. My guess is that the person writing the recipe is not English speaking. Total waste of time and money. ~P Jones, Gunnison, CO"
2002350332,264611,2018-11-27,5,"I wanted a good but easy fudge that isn't just melted chocolate chips, and this is PERFECT! I love it. I've made it several times. All the ingredients are things i usually have in the house anyway. No tricks or special tools needed. I make it exactly as the recipe says, and it comes out great every time. My Tips: *I use walnuts instead, because I like them better *I use an 8x8 pan, lined with wax paper, and just lift the fudge right out to cut when it's ready. *I make this recipe at 1.5x the ingredients, because I like my fudge a little thicker. So 3 cups of sugar, 3/4 cup milk.... * I actually use skim milk because that's what we have. It works perfectly. *I use my microwave timer for the 1 minute boil. Ezpz. *I add the pb and vanilla right to the pot instead of pouring the mixture over the pb. Just saves dishes."
2002349861,9054,2018-11-27,0,So yummy https://allasiarecipes.com/recipe/cornmeal-pancakes/
2002350252,511497,2018-11-27,5,"Great recipe! I have made 2 batches. The first time following the above recipe, and added some corn meal. Turned out great after soaking in coffee overnight and frying with butter. The second batch I substituted 1 cup of regular flour with a cup of stone ground whole wheat, and some corn meal. It turned out tasty and a wee bit softer. I dropped a new one into a cup of hot soup and let it soak up some broth and soften. Very tasty."
2001297534,311584,2018-11-27,5,I took the advice of a couple of reviewers and skipped the onions. I used my favorite beef grilling seasoning. The cube steaks were cooked on medium heat. The results were a quick and delicious protein portion for my noon meal.
2001496918,378720,2018-11-27,5,"This recipe was recently given to me by my aunt. I googled it just to see if I could find the origin and stumbled upon the exact recipe here! Made it today! It makes a lot! And I only baked a few to give as gifts. The recipe VERY good! Definite must make, but I would half the recipe, or make it, then freeze half the dough. Thank you for posting!"
2002349902,332309,2018-11-27,5,"I will definitely be making these again, especially if we have anyone staying at our house. They were so good and easy to make. Thank you for sharing this recipe!"
2000817186,69643,2018-11-27,0,I've been making Mett for a number of years and I completely agree with Chef JimmyJ. There's no way I would touch this recipe without curing salt added.
2002350242,170482,2018-11-27,1,"Bland like Oatmeal. I used almost 7/8 C. Honey, 1 tsp. cinnamon too. I didn't add the additional 2 T. of flour, like that's going to make up for the dryness and add something. Added 1/2 C. nuts. This recipe is crying out for flavor. Might need a chocolate piece on top! Or save your ingredients for a good cookie recipe."
2855524,501743,2018-11-27,5,"Added this to our Thanksgiving menu since we had a Bulgarian guest. After reading reviews decided to use Greek yogurt mixed with some milk, mostly feta cheese and bit of goat cheese, no salt. Our guest said it was very good, and everyone in the family liked it (a rarity at our house). Will make this again for sure."
2002059355,64149,2018-11-27,4,"That was wonderful!! Used spicy Italian just because we like it better, threw some cracked red chilis in and some Italian spices. I had cooked the filling the day before, so Monday dinner took merely minutes to prepare. I had cut it down to two eggs (because I hate eggs) but I won't do that again...rather, I'll bulk it up with more veggies (mushrooms, sweet bell peppers) and toss a quarter teaspoon of baking powder in with the egg/cheese mix - it seems to make it puff up and brown a little more, just makes it prettier. If I add more yummy stuff, it'll mask the egg taste ;-) Husband and one son really liked it, the other son doesn't like anything outside of big macs and gummy bears, so HIS opinion never counts. Thank you!"
266635,536363,2018-11-27,5,"What a delicious recipe -- loved the honey mustard marinade and of course, the addition of bacon and cheese. How can you go wrong? Will definitely make this chicken again."
2002144988,29939,2018-11-27,5,This is such an easy and delicious dessert to make. I will definitely be making this again in the near future. I used 3#'s of Cortland baking apples and doubled everything else and it was perfect. I love how the Amish use the simplest ingredients to create the tastiest treats.
2002350237,231036,2018-11-27,1,"Made this today, followed exact directions and it was dry and all I could taste was the baking powder. The recipe calls for 2 tsp baking powder, my standyby banana bread recipe calls for 1/2 tsp."
2000434489,411045,2018-11-27,5,"I've lived in Denver since 1990, and learned the hard way about &quot;high altitude baking&quot;. I've searched for the perfect banana bread recipe, and finally found it here! It rose perfectly, although I had to bake it for 80 minutes. Thanks so much!!"
672534,473988,2018-11-27,5,"This is a lovely cake. However, the toothpick test lied to me, and mine was underdone in the middle. Bake it until light brown on top. I felt 2 tsp. lemon zest was too much, so I'll just do 1 tsp. or less next time."
2000054650,486641,2018-11-27,5,Best I have ever made .. Thank you for sharing and God Bless
2001856928,536977,2018-11-26,5,I made this for Thanksgiving this year which was very appropriate since it was our first Thanksgiving living in Wisconsin. This was super tasty and a fun change from traditional stuffing. The only thing I might change is to reduce the chicken broth since it could have been a bit crispier. Yum!
2002336819,386357,2018-11-26,5,"I recently ate at a Mediterranean restaurant and just loved their cabbage salad. Wanting to recreate the salad, I found this recipe. It's very delicious and I believe is quite close to what I ate in the restaurant. Thanks for such a great recipe. I can't wait to try more of your recipes!"
141654,344127,2018-11-26,5,These were delish. They ran all over the pan when I cooked - may try refrigerating the &quot;batter&quot; before I cook them the next time to see if that helps. My son drizzled melted dark chocolate over 1/2 of them - tastes just like a Mounds candy bar.
2002349526,152760,2018-11-26,3,The recipe list says 3 cups of water but the instructions say 2 - what have others used?
2002155931,129533,2018-11-26,5,"DONT USE SMOKED HAM. I’ve made this several times with leftover ham and it is very good. However, I made some today following the same recipe but the ham I used was smoked, rather than the usual honey baked. It was awful and no matter what I did with adding ingredients I could not mask the smoke taste. I like smoked meats but in this recipe it was nasty."
227978,142067,2018-11-26,5,"Oh my goodness, these are so easy (and fast!) to make, and they're wonderful dinner rolls. The tops browned nicely, and the inside was fluffy and piping hot. Thanks for sharing this gem of a recipe, Bayhill. Made for Football Pool."
1516670,146119,2018-11-26,5,This was an excellent way to use up turkey leftovers! Just the right amount of herbs to compliment other ingredients. I omitted the tomato paste and increased flour to 2Tbsp. Also decreased cheese to 1/2c. Will definitely make again!
2002349085,475812,2018-11-26,5,"This was terrific! I did make some small changes and have a suggestion for next time. 1. Didn't have time to make the sauce so just served it with some vanilla ice cream. 2. Used challah bread. About 1.5 loaves. 3. Added vanilla and rum flavoring, 1 teaspoon each 4. Forgot the raisins and nuts. Would've been good. Also maybe dried cherries. 5. Was VERY sweet. Will try taking sugar down to 2.5 c. 6. Accidentally used half and half v. heavy cream. Didn't miss it at all! For all that, this is totally easy and a keeper recipe!!!"
2591900,93373,2018-11-26,0,DELICIOUS RECIPE!!! Can't wait to make this again!
2002348897,489600,2018-11-26,5,Best pie ever. I modified it slightly and used a pecan-crumble crust and it was out of this world.
2002348811,57505,2018-11-26,5,The perfect Thanksgiving leftover meal! My 9yo and 7yo boys never loved a casserole until this one. We will remake often!
2002349129,57505,2018-11-26,5,"I loved this so much! I used fettuccine noodles instead of spaghetti because they are my favorite and I doubled the batch because I have 9 people to serve, also I didn't have any mushrooms left because they had already been used in the thanksgiving stuffing but the recipe was still amazing without them, I am sure it would have been awesome with them as well. I Broiled the top of mine at the end for a couple minutes for that extra crunch effect on the bread crumb mixture. So good, even my little kids loved it which is hard to do. ~Kar"
2002348983,121456,2018-11-26,0,"If the maple syrup is used in the ingredients,are supposed to use all 2 tablespoons in the french toast mix? And if so what do you dip it in after?"
2002343114,78476,2018-11-26,5,"I made this loaf in my bread maker, took it to our Thanksgiving dinner, and boy was a huge hit!! Everyone kept asking, are you sure YOU made this bread? this is sooo good! It went like hot bread. Lol"
1670583,61990,2018-11-26,5,Made these last night and they were easy and amazing
2002348824,155430,2018-11-26,5,mmmmmm !!!!! I just made this ( used soy milk in place of water and added a tablespoon of maple syrup ) and it turned out beautifully !!!!!! Thank you !! Will be making again
2002349528,267620,2018-11-26,5,"This has been our holiday leftover soup since we printed this recipe in Dec. 2012. Perfect as originally printed. Try it. After a few years of making this soup, we have tweaked it. We simply added more carrot, celery, and diced 2 potatoes. Oh, and add both peas and corn. That's it. Enjoy! Thanks Kitten...."
2001848013,104438,2018-11-26,5,My Mom made this exact same recipe &amp; I loved them. She passed away &amp; I made these today. I had it in my cookbook but the only difference was 1/3 Cup Milk instead of 1/2 Cup ...I may have made a mistake when I copied the recipe so I used 1/2 Cup...I am from NS as well
2002348851,119842,2018-11-26,2,I don't know what I did wrong as there's not much to do but it actually had 'water' in it when it was done baking and I had to throw it out. I did put a little in each cut but it also cooked it a few minutes more. Would not try again.
2002348970,146597,2018-11-26,5,"My sister-in-law made the best stuffing balls and I always wanted the recipe but she told me she didn't go by a recipe. She just added the ingredients she bought and threw them together. Well I am her to say, these stuffing balls tasted just like the ones she made and I love them and my whole family fell in love with them. I made them for Thanksgiving and I am going to make them again for Christmas. I can see myself making them throughout the year. My family devoured them. Thank you for the recipe.."
2002349160,296110,2018-11-26,5,I was craving some stadium style nachos while watching the Portland Timbers game. I found this and experienced bliss! This is my new favorite cheese sauce! Even my dairy obsessed/vegan adverse child LOVED this sauce! I subbed jarred roasted red bell peppers for the pimentos and forgot to add the juice of the peppers and lemons. It was still amazing. Life changed.
313633,504942,2018-11-26,5,Wow this is an awesome recipe. Just realized I forgot to rate it this is the 3rd time I will be making it. Everyone in my home loves it. Thank you for posting.
2002348875,10385,2018-11-26,5,"This is typically my go-to recipe and I now live in the US so have had to modify the recipe due to which ingredients I can utilize, but all-in-all, it turns out great. Just as tasty, but not as colourful as the original. Daughter loves it, friend loves it. I have ALWAYS loved it. This is a sweet lover's recipe to keep. I would love to get fruit puffs in the US, but they would make making this too cost-prohibitive, so I use circus peanuts chopped up into pieces and call it a harvest log instead, since that candy is orange and the color of the biscuits are dark brown"
2002348261,434380,2018-11-26,5,I made the first banana Bundt Cake for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it so much I had to make another one but with cream cheese frosting this time. Best recipe ever!
2002348971,155430,2018-11-26,0,So excited to try this! All of the loaves look delicious!!
2002348444,267907,2018-11-25,0,I love turkey. I love this soup! I love Jane Brody's cookbooks &quot;Nutrition Book&quot; and &quot;Good Food Book.' She is the High Priestess of healthy eating as far as I am concerned. My mother made this soup for us half a century ago. &quot;Waste not want not&quot; se would say. Sadly I can no longer eat gluten so the barley for me is out. Jane would want us to use brown rice but brown rice is difficult to cook so I use Trader Joe's frozen cooked brown rice. Wonderful!
2002347947,373114,2018-11-25,5,"This recipe is amazing; even my small children (who are picky eaters) ate it. And not just one bite. Like, the whole serving. Score!"
2164321,89164,2018-11-25,5,"I have used this recipe many times over the years. I have made exactly as stated, and other times I have varied my use of honey instead of sugar, coconut oil instead of regular oil, and gluten free flour instead of AP. It always comes out great. I have even given mini loaves as gifts and received compliments on how yummy it is! One thing I consistently do is let it rise in my oven both times set on *warm*. Try this recipe! You can’t mess it up."
2001871644,271210,2018-11-25,5,"Restaurant quality soup, and very easy to make. My friends have asked for the recipe and my hubby wants me to make it again! If you like broccoli soup, you will love this."
2002348680,192896,2018-11-25,5,Hands down THE BEST way to make grilled cheese for a big group. The fam absolutely loved them. They turned out perfect. I will never make grilled cheese “the old way” ever again.
2001217960,124601,2018-11-25,5,"My daughter loves yoo-hoo, I had her taste this, she made a ehh face, so I needed to tweak it. All together I added 2 more cups of water, 2 more heaping Tbsps neskwik chocolate, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. She drank a whole glass!"
2002347949,496461,2018-11-25,5,I did it and it was delicious - it even pleased a 14 year old Cambodian boy who is away from home. Added sauteed zucchini from the garden and fresh lettuce too. Just left out the cucumbers - can't stand them. Well done - it may not be like other recipes but it was fresh and tasty and the balance of oyster and fish sauce seemed great to me.
2001928915,83708,2018-11-25,5,"Made this with SF raspberry jello, using 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream...yum yum!! Perfect treat for diabetics like me. Thanks for sharing, Lisa!! Can't wait to try some other flavors...definitely making this again!!"
2002347264,529975,2018-11-25,5,Crunchy and satisfying! Next time I will use 2 baking sheets to roll them thinner.
2002348301,343412,2018-11-25,5,SOOOO good! Make sure you make for 13 mins on 350.
2002347738,89204,2018-11-25,4,Very good.
2002347863,64446,2018-11-25,5,"This recipe is a staple in my house, and my husband's friends have a standing order: if it's a birthday or a holiday, please have J bake that bread!! I add a little garlic when I want to pair this with pasta, it works beautifully. FYI, I made this recipe once with bread flour instead of all purpose. Absolutely skip this idea, the bread comes out way way way too dense and the heaviness takes away a lot of flavor. Don't bother with that experiment, I already did it for you and it was terrible."
2002347934,125658,2018-11-25,5,"Scrumtious. We made these for a friends dinner and everyone loved them, including the children. We used small tart shells so they were bite size."
2002347740,339905,2018-11-25,0,great basic loaf. I add 1 tablespoon milk powder too
2002214592,116245,2018-11-25,0,Steak-ums really ! LOL and store bought dough and it is an editor’s pick!
2002348686,510905,2018-11-25,5,Well it's bacon wrapped pork chops...I mean.. Come on..I tweaked it .I used a brown sugar with Cayenne and chili powder rub.. Will probably serve with Russell's ghost pepper BBQ sauce.. I'm a pepper head lol.. But this BBQ sauce if you can find it is probably about the best on the market really balanced.. Not all heat.. But it's there
2002348529,38558,2018-11-25,4,"Thanks for sharing. I threw out a huge pot of venison c.hili this week because we could not take the saltiness! Home made beans on a slow cooker, fresh veggies, tomatos— we could not figure out where on earch the horrible saltiness was coming from! ...until i looked up the salt content in chili powder! Mystery solved. I amgoing to double this batch and freeze it in Ziploc aloquots."
2002148671,105054,2018-11-25,5,"Love this recipe. I didn't have instant coffee so I did what a friend of mine's mother always did with chocolate cake, I added 2 tablespoons of my morning coffee. Out standing. When you add the extra flour it's perfect. Great cookies."
2000700809,442873,2018-11-25,5,My daughter made these. She is 15 and an inexperienced baker. It's true that the sugar isn't mentioned in the recipe but these turned out great and are really delicious.
2002347786,104737,2018-11-25,5,"This is not only the best dressing I have ever made, it is absolutely the best dressing I have ever EATEN! While the flavor was perfection, next time, I might add eggs to help bind it, as it was pretty loose. The only tweaks I made were: 1) I added 2 Granny Smith apples, chopped 2) I lightly roasted the cranberries (maybe 10 min) while toasting the cornbread, so I didn't cook them with the onions and celery."
157425,261263,2018-11-25,5,I love orange cranberry anything so half the batter I made as written and the other half added some Craisins. Both muffins were very good and didnt last long around here. Liked that they were crunchy around the edges and moist inside. I put everything in my KA mixer and in no time the batter was ready to go. Will make these again soon! Made and reviewed for the recipe tag game For Your Consideration.
2002348015,115731,2018-11-25,5,"We don't usually like roasted cauliflower-- it often turns out bland. But this was really good, and I will definitely be making this again. I second another reviewer about lightly salting the cauliflower before it goes in the oven. Cheers"
2002348219,507110,2018-11-25,5,"Hold the wagon. This is the best beef dish I've had in my entire life. WOW. If Jaimie Oliver visited Wyoming in 1918, this would've been the meal of choice for the governor. Fabulous flavor, incredible texture. And remember with brisket... 190 to 195 (for an extended time period) is WHEN the texture becomes melty and soft -- not lower than that. Counter-intuitive but important to remember! Enjoy this pure heaven."
2002348634,378575,2018-11-25,5,When I was a teenager Christie's Cookies had a store next to the photography booth I worked at located inside the Opryland Theme park. This was 1991ish. They were amazing then. They are amazing now. The first time I made this recipe was before I had a kitchenaid. I had a JC Penny brand stand mixer and smoke started coming off the motor. Its pretty thick. The Goodwill stand mixer died that day but it was worth it. At that time that stand mixer was decades old and it did come from Goodwill as that was all that I could afford.
2002348138,13700,2018-11-25,5,this was just great . made some as a test for a party teens ate the whole lot lol
2002347854,282620,2018-11-25,5,"Excellent recipe and base for creativity! I change it up a bit every time I make it and it's become a family favorite. I love adding diced onions, diced bell peppers, minced garlic, salsa, sour cream, shredded cheddar, fresh rosemary, cilantro and sage; however, nothing is really needed because the original recipe is deliciius! So glad to have found this recipe."
2002311173,466900,2018-11-25,5,Really easy so delicious ??
2002348190,79563,2018-11-25,5,I didn't think I liked split pea soup until I found this recipe! Now the family requests it every time we have a leftover ham bone
2002348649,67256,2018-11-25,5,"Loved this recipe! Moist, flavorful, but sturdy for filling and stacking a four-layer cake! My notes: - Single recipe made. - 3.5 Bananas needed. - Batter split between three 6&quot; x 3&quot; round cake tins. Two 6-inch tins filled 2/3 full - done at 70 minutes - each tin torted into two layers. One 6-inch tin filled 1/2 full - done at 50 minutes - torted into one layer."
2000794075,73391,2018-11-25,5,Thank you for preserving the legacy of this recipe (w/o the tomato sauce) aired in the Molto Mario show back in the 90'!!!
2002346871,151292,2018-11-24,0,This recipe doesn’t include the very important art of boiling eggs. Google how to perfect hard boiling eggs. It’s well worth the effort. I make fabulous deviled eggs and the perfect boiled eggs are the start. Not hard to do but essential techniques
2002346878,236900,2018-11-24,4,"A hit at Thanksgiving! I’d add a pinch of salt to the cornstarch mixture and a little lemon juice to the fruit to avoid blandness. And I think I’d make a lattice crust with 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I served with whipped heavy cream to which I had added 1/4 cup sour cream, vanilla, and 1/4 t cardamom. I love that flavor!"
2000772141,278583,2018-11-24,5,"It was delicious, but I think I could cut back on the amount of crust topping next time and it will be just as good. It is so high in calories, I would only make it for a holiday meal"
1350325,12291,2018-11-24,5,"Very good recipe! Try it exactly the way it was written the first time you make it. Then, if you feel like you want to make tweaks. Tweak it."
2002347044,465577,2018-11-24,2,"Definitely not a fan favorite. Although I measured everything perfectly, the applesauce completely overwhelms the other flavors and the yogurt adds an awful tanginess to it. You end up with a tangy, applesauce pie instead of a different version of pumpkin pie. I will never do this one again."
2002346918,93840,2018-11-24,5,Made it with chives and chicken and it was delicious! The cream cheese was a real high point
2002347358,101954,2018-11-24,5,"I made this for Thanksgiving. In addition to this pie, I had pumpkin, cherry crumb, apple and an Oreo cream. The pecan and the Oreo cream went first...I had a handful of people tell me his was the best pecan pie they’ve ever had. Super easy. I made it according to directions. Thank you!"
1233183,184270,2018-11-24,5,These things always go quickly wherever I bring them. A tip to get them out is letting them cool for about 10 minutes in the pan and then drop it on a counter.
2002347410,184442,2018-11-24,5,This is now my sweet go to! You really can't get much more simple and quick than this. Thank you!
2002347704,170266,2018-11-24,0,"Hi Brenda! I have a very similar old family recipe that I've been using for years. Lately once a week. You need more flour 1-3/4cups. Omit the Baking Soda. It adds nothing. My recipe calls for buttermilk also, but I use milk or half&amp;half or coffee cream instead. I leave the vanilla and the lemon zest. I don't add the pecans... But I do have my own twist. I push sliced canned peaches slightly into the top of the batter. I usually double the recipe and bake it into a cake form. Or as of late make Mini loaves lol"
2001362355,57505,2018-11-24,5,"Good combination of veggies, left over turkey and whole wheat pasta in a creamy sauce."
2001247222,414809,2018-11-24,5,Wonderful! Made it exactly to the recipe and it came out great. Ate it with Jasmine rice. Ordered the saffron from Amazon and it was the first time having something with saffron.
2002346928,356428,2018-11-24,1,This was so salty. Such a waste of good ingredients. Why would you use the name Julia Child? I have made her recipe and it is superb. .
2002346996,374398,2018-11-24,5,I have made this exact recipe for my family 3 times now. The flavor of each ingredient mesh so well with one another. This omelet is absolutely divine. You won’t leave hungry. I will be adding this recipe to my family recipe book to keep forever. Thank you Dienia.
129255,37490,2018-11-24,5,Favorite scone recipe! I skip the freezer step and they always turn out great anyway. We like them served with strawberries over the top too...sort of like an elegant strawberry shortcake. :) thanks for sharing! Postnote: I glazed them with a maple glaze and they are sooooo.... good!
2002260963,88180,2018-11-24,5,These are by far the best deviled eggs I have ever eaten. They were a huge hit at thanksgiving!
2002347570,535958,2018-11-24,5,"Perfect because you don't have to worry about your sauce breaking!!! I did add some cayenne, garlic powder, mustard powder and Worcestershire sauce but that's personal preference. Great base recipe!"
2002347397,275694,2018-11-24,5,"This is an excellent comfort food on a cold day! I've made it a few times with variations depending on what's in the kitchen: adding mushrooms, mixing beef and sausage, adding cajun seasoning, etc. Very adaptable."
2002347454,162894,2018-11-24,5,I made this twice for trips in our motorhome and both times I used sweet potato orzo that I happened to find at a local shop. My husband told me I could make this as often as I wanted with absolutely no complaints from him! We are leaving in two days for another trip. This time I have a bag of lemon orzo to try!!
2002347101,339453,2018-11-24,5,"I just got a roaster and used it for the first time this Thanksgiving. I did 2 small turkeys to be on the safe side, one in the oven and the other in the roaster, using this recipe. It browned nicely and all agreed that it was fabulous! Next year i will do one big turkey in the roaster and will use this recipe again. It's so easy too with no basting."
2002347121,13614,2018-11-24,5,"My husband is Danish, family still lives there and I can tell you that this recipe is the closest I have found with the American measurements! These cookies are so popular with my family and friends that we make multiple batches each year. Yes it is important to wrap them carefully and refrigerate for 2-3 works before baking. I grind my almonds which makes them easier to slice. That is the only hard part to this recipe. The ammonia can be ordered online or purchased at a good Italian or ethnic supermarket. Highly recommend!"
2002346966,169243,2018-11-24,5,My husband and I loved it! Used dried rosemary and thyme. Still turned out great! I will put this on my list of standards!
2002347179,46776,2018-11-24,0,"This is the best dressing EVER! The instructions say bake for 30 minutes, but it took more like 50 minutes in my oven. I used 2 packages of the Shawnee Mills Buttermilk Yellow Cornbread Mix, and 1 14 oz package of Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Classic Stuffing Mix. Super moist and DELICIOUS!"
2002219164,433190,2018-11-24,5,Made my first one today in my ninja processor and dough is perfect!
2002346708,515993,2018-11-23,5,"We made these at 8,300ft and they turned out great! They leavened perfectly and were very moist. Love that they don’t have nuts so my son can take them to school. I only used half of the crumble topping to cut the sugar a bit and I doubled the spices in the batter because I really enjoy tasting the spices."
2001827984,51537,2018-11-23,0,"Way too salty....and very crumbly, ..."
2001355273,102073,2018-11-23,5,"Hands down, the BEST Pumpkin Pie I’ve ever had! Made this for Thanksgiving &amp; boy, it was a big t. Can’t wait to have another piece tonight. I made it with home made pumpkin pur&eacute;e &amp; made 1 jumbo pie instead of 2 smaller pies. Will definitely be making this again, Soon! Thanks CarrolJ =D"
2002346480,332323,2018-11-23,1,"Followed the recipe to a T. Came out grainy and way too sugary. Very soft. Did exactly 4 min. Needs to be an easier way to make it perfect every time. Unfortunately, you don't know if it is right until it is done. They were a flop for me."
2001604211,53878,2018-11-23,0,pepperoni and cream cheese are not orange. what else is in there?
2002346069,484241,2018-11-23,0,This a keeper. This wowed the in-laws.
2002346509,87420,2018-11-23,5,I made this last night and it was the best. I will definately be making again.
2002346757,183510,2018-11-23,5,Followed the recipe but added bacon in the middle and spicy ketchup on top for the last 10-15 min of baking. Bomb!
2002346306,174674,2018-11-23,5,"I made these yesterday for an ethnic food potluck I had with my university students. I'm Serbian and love proja. These were amazing, so light and fluffy! A nice contrast to the sometimes dense and dry proja that others make. I wanted to spice them up a little bit, and although not as traditionally Serbian, I added in garlic, onions and spinach. I also served them with tzatziki and ajvar (a Serbian roasted red pepper dip). Absolutely delicious, thank you Ivana! I will definitely try them next time with feta."
2001233436,73166,2018-11-23,5,"I've made this chili for several years now, it's the only recipe my family wants. I never put the beer and sometimes I skip the coffee. It is great!"
80079,336376,2018-11-23,5,"Wow. This was fantastic. Glad I doubled the recipe and made two! I did increase the chocolate chips, just because I know my family’s love for dark chocolate. Served this at Thanksgiving topped with Chantilly Cream made with Godiva liquor and Jack Daniels."
2002346291,101954,2018-11-23,5,"I've been using this recipe, for 3 years now, on Thanksgiving. I'm officially the &quot;dessert person&quot; now."
2002346639,101954,2018-11-23,5,I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! I followed the directions 100% (including the sifting of the sugar and eggs). The pie wasn't insanely sweet (a perfect amount of sweet) and the pecans were just the right amount! I did follow the suggestion to pre-melt the butter before adding it in. That just made the mixing easier. :) If you want an easy pecan pie recipe that tastes amazing- give this one a try!
2213921,295072,2018-11-23,1,"In my family, our version of this is doesn't use lemon extract but I've been making it for major holidays since leaving the nest. For kicks I followed this recipe and after one bite, trashed the entire batch. We found there was an unpleasant aftertaste."
1803720432,84504,2018-11-23,5,"I'm an avid cook/baker and this ranks high on my list. I doubled the recipe (2 times every ingredient) and did substitute the flour for oats. I roasted some organic sweet potatoes first and then dumped everything (except the topping) into a food processor. I baked it in a long oval shallow casserole dish and the baking time came to just under one hour. I didn't add the marshmallows, but will probably edge the casserole with them next time (for me). Rave reviews at today's Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks so much for a very perfect recipe!"
2001703847,61755,2018-11-23,5,These are so good!!! Easy to make
1375557,25658,2018-11-23,5,Awesome! This recipe was so easy and delicious. I made extra icing and I used the suggestion of several others to cut down the brown sugar to 3/4 c. I will be making this again.
2002225908,46780,2018-11-23,5,"I did the water bath with this recipe and it took about 65-70 mins. It turned out great, everyone loved it!"
2002346379,144962,2018-11-23,4,"I have not yet tried the recipe, but I will soon. My response is basically to do with what appears to be a lot of bickering over sugar substitutes. This website address will give you current sugar substitute information. https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm397716.htm. The page is dated from 2014 but you will see at the bottom of the article it was updated this year. Basically all sugar substitutes tested by the FDA are safe for human consumption. The main caveat is to not over do it. Stevia as we see in the store is considered safe, however there are some issues with actual stevia plant leaves... in other words you can't grow your own. Happy Holidays!"
2002114649,536568,2018-11-23,5,One of the best recipes I've come across. I substituted sour cream for the yogurt (not a yogurt fan at all) and the results were very similar to a sour-cream coffee cake. Running it under the broiler is brilliant. Not only a keeper but a go-to breakfast/brunch favorite.
2002346480,407995,2018-11-23,5,"This Cheesecake comes out perfect! Was the hit of a desert party! We spread the sauce over the cooled Cheesecake and sprinkled the nuts in the center. Rave reviews from the guests. People were eating two and three slices! NOTE: When you refrigerate the Cheesecake, use aluminum foil to cover it. If you use plastic wrap, and it touches the pretty cheesecake top, it will remove some of the top layer. We fixed the error by spreading about 2/3 of the sauce over the top to cover it up."
2574795,113419,2018-11-23,5,Excellent. I did use 1/4th cup each of mayo and sour cream and increased the Old Bay and hot sauce slightly. Also used 8 oz of crab. Be sure to serve with a good quality bread or cracker—I used artisan French baguette thinly sliced into “chips” and lightly toasted. Got rave reviews as appetizer at Thanksgiving dinner!
2002346768,264333,2018-11-23,5,"Great recipe. My only complaint is the silken tofu was too wet and soft. I drained it for quite some time to keep it from making the bottom of the spanakopita soggy. Next time I will use firm tofu and crumble it. My changes were: fresh oregano to the tofu, red bell pepper and 1 red onion sauteed with 1 pound of fresh spinach."
2001365069,356134,2018-11-23,5,"Made it for Thanksgiving covered dish. I used mixed color carrots and peeled and sliced lengthwise and then into 1-inch segments. I cooked the carrots first in the instapot for 3 minutes on high pressure using a steamer basked with 1 cup of water. Pressure cooking preserved nutrients, flavor and brightened the colors over boiling them. Then I roasted 40 minutes. Next time I will back the roast time down to 30ish. I used a squeeze bottle to mix and sprinkle the oil, vinegar, brown sugar. Then I sprinkled with sea salt, black fresh ground pepper and Penzy's Bavarian blend seasoning mix before roasting. It was delicious! None left at the end of the dinner. I used 3 lbs and tripled everything for 17 people."
2001181064,196153,2018-11-23,1,"What a total waste. Goopy sloppy wet mashed potatoes. Didn't use but maybe 1/3 of the milk. Only 1 cup of water to the 5 lbs potatoes (Yukon Gold). I'll stick to my usual - make mashed potatoes on the stove, then just transfer to a crock pot to keep warm for 1-2 hours."
2000121372,446972,2018-11-23,5,"First off, I had a devil of a time trying to leave a review. Several attempts at several locations, but I'm here and I really wanted to review this recipe. I made it to the recipe, except I added 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie seasoning, and used a water bath while baking. I did have to cook it for 1 hr and 20 minutes. It was done perfectly, and it was a hit with our Thanksgiving crowd. Cheesecakes aren't the easiest to get done right. As a rule, when it's just soft near the middle, it's done!"
2002346140,48914,2018-11-23,5,"I've made this twice now. Forgot to save it the first time and was stuck searching the internet far and wide for this recipe. This is the only one that uses JUST ricotta and not cream cheese and mascarpone! It is SO delicious, all the other desserts don't stand a chance to this cheesecake. If made the right way, it's sure to please. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!! It's my new go-to."
2002346451,339453,2018-11-23,5,"This is the first year that I have used an electric roaster, and I was concerned about many reviews elsewhere that said the turkey was pale and did not brown. I didn't want to use Kitchen bouquet. I used this recipe and it turned out so good! The skin was brown and crispy and the turkey was delish."
266635,502700,2018-11-23,5,This stew came together quickly and it looks so nice with all the colors. Great aroma too with all the warm spices. I cooked the stew longer to ensure that the beef was tender nice and tender. Will serve over rice for dinner tonight.
2002346758,85149,2018-11-23,1,I don't get when people feel they have to rewrite other recipes. Just write your own. In any event I just had this at Thanksgiving yesterday and it was winderful!
2002346720,384181,2018-11-23,4,I've made this recipe several times (in different ovens) and I've always had to bake it quite a bit longer in order for the center to be done. Great recipe though.
2002346833,93840,2018-11-23,5,Finally a good homemade version! Kids and husband were happy
42847186,151774,2018-11-23,2,"Didn't love it... the pears gave it a strange texture... I made the broth but threw it out, as it was very dark in color and would've turned the soup and ugly brown color. I was serving this to guest so I did not want to take a chance! I used chicken broth instead."
2002346296,400501,2018-11-23,5,"This is by far our favorite cranberry cake recipe! I've been making it for a few years, with rave reviews from my friends. Thank you for making it available!"
2412523,339453,2018-11-23,5,Followed the receipt in a rather small roaster for a 13 pound turkey and it turned out great.
2002344766,105193,2018-11-23,5,"Made it for Thanksgiving, left out the nutmeg as it's not a family favorite spice. Family loved it!"
2002045911,57062,2018-11-23,5,"Loved that this recipe provides all of the basics but allows for so many variations. I added sour cream, garlic powder and scallions in addition to the suggestion ingredients. I also omitted extra salt. I topped the potatoes with a sprinkle of pepper jack cheese because that's what I had on hand. Next time I may try subbing the cream cheese for garlic herb Boursin cheese which I've added to mashed potato casseroles in the past."
42962512,261889,2018-11-23,5,This is by far the best dough recipe easy and grand kids love cleaning out the bowl
2002346354,146420,2018-11-23,5,Made this day b4 Thanksgiving and it was amazing.Best filling ever. Used to live in Pa Dutch country and now in Florida. Followed recipe exactly except used seasoned bread cubes. Will now be making this every year.
1469340,90765,2018-11-23,5,This bread is absolutely delicious. I also use it to make dinner rolls and everyone loves it! I make the dough in my WonderMix and it only takes a few minutes. I've even only let it rise 1 hour before when short on time and it's still perfect.
2001906623,41541,2018-11-23,5,"Delicious. The day before Thanksgiving, I peeled &amp; cut up the sweet potatoes, tossed them in oil &amp; roasted for 35 minutes at 350 (turning them after 20 mins). I made the sauce, poured it over the hot potatoes &amp; tossed them to cover. Let them cool, refrigerate overnight. On Thanksgiving I baked them for 30 minutes at 350. These were highly complimented and there were no leftovers!"
2002346318,412096,2018-11-23,5,Thank you for this recipe. I developed a corn allergy a few years ago which prevented me from being able to use store bought soups in my recipes. This mushroom soup sauce has been exactly what I have been looking for to use in place of Campbells Golden Mushroom soup. Today I am using this to make my Mom's homemade stuffing which I haven't been able to eat since my corn allergy developed.
2001631720,262793,2018-11-23,5,This was indeed a great recipe. Flavors was awesome. I baked them and they came out great. Cant wait to throw them on the grill.
2002346175,292563,2018-11-23,5,"Excellent all around. This amount of dough is perfect for 9” spring form - just enough to line, cover and decorate. Not greasy at all. I used tallow (rendered cow fat) in place of lard, as I ran out of lard and it was too late to run to the store. I prepared the filling before making the dough, which worked well - I didn’t have to fiddle with keeping the dough warm. I added dry cranberries to the filling and skipped the lemon zest. Turkey was used instead of chicken in keeping with a thanksgiving theme. Work quickly, press neatly, and pay attention to detail. Thanks for the great post! It made an excellent Thanksgiving dinner for us."
1599750,155444,2018-11-23,2,"Yikes! I made this exactly as written and it had a very noticeable aspartame aftertaste. I will not make it with pudding again, but will try draining the fruit and making a dressing out of nonfat plain Greek yogurt sweetened with some stevia and thinned with a bit of almond milk if necessary."
2002346445,14979,2018-11-23,5,I had never made a cream pie although it’s my absolute favorite so I thought it was about time. This was so good that a family friend had FOUR slices over the course of thanksgiving day. My 3 year old said that he didn’t want ‘brown pie’ aka pumpkin pie but that he wanted the ‘banilla’ one. Fair enough. Thank you so much. Not only do I now know how to scald milk but I can make cream pie!
2002097164,28758,2018-11-22,5,I made this pie (doubled and made 2) and it is fabulous!! I normally just use the one on the side of the pumpkin can but I tried this one for Thanksgiving this year (2018) and it was great! Some of the comments on the website mentioned that it was too sweet but I didn’t find that to be the case. Family enjoyed it too and felt that they were even better than the ones I normally make. I followed the recipe exactly (except to double for the second pie) and it was well balanced. Will use this one again next year.
2002345949,339453,2018-11-22,5,"I used this recipe and mine was done much faster (2 hours for 20.5 pounds). The skin was crisp and perfect, and the meat was tender. Great Recipe! I also loved the suggestion to use a wired thermometer. That was a life saver!"
2002345961,339453,2018-11-22,5,"Followed the recipe exactly, had an 8.8 lb lil butterball, stuffed full with some home made stuffing butter all over and finished off with a drizzle of olive oil, roaster maxed out at 450 for the first 30, turned it down to 325 for another 2 hours and it was done to perfection. Took the roaster insert out of the actual unit and let it sit with the lid on for the remaining 30 minutes of rest time. I also dry brined it for 24 hours before and let it sit for an hour before cooking. It made an amazing gravy too!! This was not my first turkey, but this was my first Thanksgiving that I was cooking the entire meal, so I found this recipe while looking to figure out how to free up oven space and save on time and effort, will be using this from now on!"
2002344415,46780,2018-11-22,3,"I made this cheesecake and included ginger, nutmeg and more allspice because i felt it was too bland. Overall the texture under the crust was silky but my biggest complaint was the 60 minutes was far too long. It had browned the edges of the cheesecake a lot. I initially worried it was burnt but it wasnt just super browned. The top also naturally got still almost like a film on the top. I'll stick to 50 minutes next time."
2002345967,339453,2018-11-22,5,I have used this recipe for the past 3 years for a 22 pound turkey. It is so easy and always turns out perfectly.
2002345746,339453,2018-11-22,0,"I hope it tastes good. After following directions, should've been finished an hour ago. Breast still reading 140, thigh 160. Looks like it has been steamed. Still anticipating greatness. Make sure to give yourself plenty of time for issues as this"
2002345118,339453,2018-11-22,1,I followed instructions to the letter and this turkey was soooo dry. Did not turn out good at all. I would not recommend this recipe.
2002345090,63827,2018-11-22,0,Love this I tweaked mine a little and definently blended it more so there were no lumps at all add bananas in the mix and more cool whip! Everyone is gonna love this and my 7 yr old tested it and approved!! Thanks
2001362355,74982,2018-11-22,5,Great recipe for Thanksgiving! Just added a little maple syrup.
2001856260,345444,2018-11-22,5,"I pur&eacute;ed the cooked bacon with cream of mushroom, cream of chicken, onion, tricolored bell peppers, shredded cheese, Philadelphia cream cheese, added garlic, pepper and salt to taste. once this was all pur&eacute;ed together I poured it over my hash browns cubed style. Mixed well and placed in my casserole dish then cover with shredded cheese and covered with foil. Baked 45 minutes then uncovered and baked the last 15 minutes on convection to brown the top! Perfect dish ready to take for thanksgiving dinner"
2582337,354563,2018-11-22,5,Best macaroni and cheese ever! Everyone loved it!
2002345459,334865,2018-11-22,5,Our family favorite hands down. My daughter uses condensed almond milk and it's still delicious. I use a combination of honey and maple syrup!
1924549,355893,2018-11-22,2,"I had trouble getting the gelatin to thicken. The protease in pineapple tends to destroy jellos. I'd hoped the boiling of the pineapple would help, but it didn't seem to. Not sure where I went wrong. Taste was good, though."
2002344739,132488,2018-11-22,5,"A counter to the reviews posting the equal parts sugar to flour and butter. I've made this recipe twice trying to get it to do so, with both chilled and room temperature butter, but the batter never cooked evenly, crisping up at the edges, while the middle remained a bubbly liquid for 20-30 minutes. In addition, if you use pop-able pie tins, the butter will leak, everywhere. The addition of flour in slightly higher proportions evens out the liquids balance and causes it to bake evenly. A family favorite, no matter your preferred measurements!"
2001271282,432736,2018-11-22,5,"After reading the reviews, I also only used 1/4 C Splenda. I also added 1 scraped vanilla bean along with 1T homemade vanilla extract. Mine turned out a bit lumpy, possibly cooked a bit too long. It's going into another recipe so it should be ok."
2001501929,146597,2018-11-22,4,"I thought these were good. However, despite baking them on parchment paper they still got a little dark on the bottoms. Still good IMO. I liked the crunchiness. Hubby said they were good but he still prefers the more traditional stuffing, the wetter kind. I followed the recipe mostly as written but I used vegetable stock instead of chicken(personal preference) and used two eggs instead of one. I forgot to get cranberry sauce; I think if we'd had that to dip them into it would have been even better. Thank you for posting the recipe."
2002345309,80156,2018-11-22,5,"Easy and so delicious! Perfect instructions for baking times, too! Thank you!"
1072593,313501,2018-11-22,5,"Happy Thanksgiving! And for a such great breakfast recipe, some very special hugs and quiches to you, madame!"
2002334242,33671,2018-11-22,5,Amazing. Best chicken ever!
2002344152,277852,2018-11-22,5,I was really impressed with this recipe. I am making it for the second time tonight for Thanksgiving tomorrow.
2002345511,97496,2018-11-22,5,New family favorite! They are the perfect amount of sweet! :)
2000469815,518718,2018-11-22,5,I have made this dessert for the last 2 years and had to come back to find it again. It was great and a hit with my whole family. I used can peaches in it's original juice.
2002344910,340469,2018-11-22,5,I searched &quot;not too sweet sweet potato recipe&quot; while preparing for our dinner club's last meeting at our home. This recipe was perfect. Everyone loved it. We are having it again today for Thanksgiving.
2002344409,608,2018-11-22,5,"This Five Bean Salad is just like my Grand Aunts version which brought back childhood memories of my family holidays from over 60 years ago, but this version is sweet as was my Grand Aunt Pearl’s version. However for a more modern taste, I substituted Butter Beans for the Lima Beans (I like them, but most don't). Also, I added 1/2 each diced red pepper and green pepper, 1 diced serrano chili (adjust per your taste), 1/2 diced cucumber, 8 cloves diced garlic, and 1/2 bunch chopped parsley. To boost the flavor profile, I infused the oil with a 1/2 tsp. each garlic powder, onion powder and dried basil, combined with the 1 tsp. each salt, black pepper, dry mustard and the celery seeds. As for the Sugar, I used brown sugar (to add a little carmel to the flavor profile) for half the adjusted (1/3 to 1/2 cup) sugar in this recipe."
2002345828,434140,2018-11-22,3,Margerine tends to separate from sugar while cooking. Finished product is extremely light in color and caramel flavor; texture on the course side.
2001773389,144543,2018-11-22,2,"We like the flavor of this but it does not come out done after 45 minutes, or even an hour! It is mushy and surrounded with liquid. The juice does not cook away as the recipe says."
2123645,137368,2018-11-22,4,"Delicious! I love the dressing and combination of flavors. Everything cooked up perfectly. I think next time I would use only 1 - 2 tablespoons oil to roast the veggies in, 1/4 cup was a bit heavy."
204024,537175,2018-11-22,5,"Loved these warm delicious rolls. So easy to make and such a quick turnaround. To quote my son in law &quot;I like 'em&quot;, DH loved baking them in the skillet."
2002246584,80594,2018-11-22,5,We've been making these for more than three years now. We use baby carrots that are ready to cook when we want to save prep time. Everyone who tastes this recipe comments on it and loves it. Great job &amp; thanks!
2002345786,78429,2018-11-22,0,I’ve been in love with date pudding for over 40 years. Sadly I lost my original recipe. For 25 years I’ve been trying to recreate that memory. I’m blown away. This is the best I’ve ever had. Balanced sweetness slightly crunchy.....I’ve stopped looking.. I recommend based on those 25 years of trials that you use one and half (1 1/2) cup of water... doing so creates a creamy syrup once baked spoon it over the breading...just heavenly. Cheers to whoever posted this winner!!!
400708,532179,2018-11-22,4,"I followed the directions exactly or at least I think I did. The crust was to thick and I'm sure that's my issue as I'm not the best at pastries. They do have a wonderful flavor of pecans, but thinking next time I'd reduce the pecans to about 3/4 pound as it was so full of pecans I had trouble even mixing and the finished product was to heavy in pecans for what I was expecting. Other than that, great flavor and was enjoyed."
2002344091,53066,2018-11-22,0,I found this recipe on another website with the Food.com copyright and it was nothing like this. It told the maker to knead the dough and not worry about the consistence because the the Bisquick would solidify it. But it never state how much additional Bisquick one would need while kneading it. I ended up just about doing what you state in the recipe and crossed my fingers. I did however poured all the melted butter in that pan at one time(recipe said so) The biscuits turned out so good after all. However I am keeping your and pitching the other. Yours makes more sense and far better written. Thank you from a seasoned baker/cook
2123645,343049,2018-11-22,5,Amazing! Tastes just like pumpkin pie.
2002343115,35568,2018-11-22,5,"This was awsome. However, because I had 2 cups of fresh pumpkin I wanted to use, I tripped the spices and added more sugar and a tiny bit of salt in that part of the layer. This is one the best tasting cheesecakes I have had."
2123551,174691,2018-11-22,5,"This recipe was easy to prepare and delicious! All of the flavors complemented each other beautifully. Next time, I will add red pepper flakes for a lil kick. A definite keeper."
2000974150,531158,2018-11-22,2,"The boneless chops were dry as dust. In fact, everything I"
2002144215,372377,2018-11-22,5,Omg! The best! I did a vegan version of this and I think this is the best soup I ever had!!
2002345473,101954,2018-11-22,5,"This is how my mom taught me to make pecan pie. It is a huge holiday favorite in our family and I misplaced the recipe. Thank you so very much for posting this!! My only slight change is to use the pecan halves with out breaking them. It looks more generous somehow without any difference to the amount of nuts. Thanks again!! You saved Thanksgiving!!! (Oh yeah, all dark Karo for this family.)"
2421176,101954,2018-11-22,5,"Great recipe, first pecan I ever tried. As others suggested cooking the sugar and corn syrup prior is key. I also stirred the mixture constantly while cooling. I soften the butter and it mixed in just fine. I baked it for 45 minutes. The middle was a little jiggly but sets pretty quickly. I followed the directions and ingredients exactly."
2002344582,470157,2018-11-22,1,"I love bing bars; however, I think this recipie (at least on my screen) is missing most of the directions. You need to melt the butter (oleo), marshmallows, sugar, evaporated milk and salt into a thick buttery looking syrup. (I believe you add the vanilla in this step but cannot remember for sure from when my grandma made this recipie). Then you remove from the heat and add the cherry chips and mix until melted and blended. Spread in a 9x13 pan and chill until set. Then make the chocolate top mixture by melting the chocolate and pb together. I add a little milk to make sure it is spreadable. Then mix in chopped nuts and spread over chilled cherry mixture. I do love these bars!"
2123645,138173,2018-11-22,4,"I can't eat onion very well, but I had a small taste and they were delicious. Instead of chopping the onions by hand, I put them in the food processor. I think this caused more liquid to be released, so my batter was a little thin. If you do use the food processor, I would recommend draining the onions first before adding to batter."
2002345452,147772,2018-11-22,5,"This is our go to recipe for rum cream. I use Cacique Mexican Crema for the cream. I have also started adding a shot of Azteca chocolate bitters. Just ramps it all up even better. We use Captain Morgan Private Stock rum, which is kinda spendy at $25 a bottle, but oh so good with a strong caramel and vanilla goodness to it."
2002201359,244887,2018-11-22,5,I love this recipe!! I do 2 cups of cheddar in with the potato mixture then 2 cups of cheddar on top. I love mine super cheesy!! I also put 2 sandwich baggies worth of corn flakes. Thank you for the recipe!
2002345991,529705,2018-11-22,5,I had to taste test a couple different burbons to find the right one. I added a bit (about a shots worth) more of the whiskey to the sauce too. Gives it a really nice complexity. This sauce is spicy and super tasty. Thanks for this great Recipie.
2002344323,434789,2018-11-22,3,"This cake turned out rich - extremely rich. I guess I should have seen it, considering the amount of butter used in the recipe. I'm guessing my choice of extracts had something to do with the flavor leaving room for improvement, but I also wonder if another type of filling between the layers would have improved the flavor. The cake got a lot of compliments when I served it, but I probably will not use this recipe again - at least not without some serious modifications."
2002344419,14796,2018-11-22,5,"This is a great recipe! It always comes out perfect for me. The cheesecake is always delicious, and I can easily create variations by using various toppings or swirling in things like melted chocolate or raspberry sauce."
2002344618,102725,2018-11-22,5,This is an old recipe from Bon Appetit magazine. It is the Boomb by the way. We call it the plate licker. Simple and fantastic
2002083474,4423,2018-11-22,5,Recipes is very easy and combines two of my favorite foods very good and everyone loves it definately a keeper Thanks so much for the recipie
2002310455,59609,2018-11-22,5,"Made the recipe exactly as written and added in some chopped ham. I didn’t have Gruyere so I used shredded Colby Jack, and it worked just as well! Rotated the puffs halfway through. One of the tricks to keeping these from deflating after they come out of the oven is to leave them in for about 5 min with the oven door slightly cracked to “dry” out the centers. Instant hit!"
2002344762,344870,2018-11-22,0,"I learned not to let it boil or uou will get scrambled eggs I used pure vanilla,vit D milk,fresh cornstarch and stirred most the time cooking.I stopped stirring to see the bubbles form.This is an excellent recipe.Make fresh caramel to coat the bottom of your bowl.My kick like pom creme brule!"
2002344657,113602,2018-11-22,5,"This was amazing! I LoVe marzipan and when I came across this looking for something different to make it was a no brainer to try. My loaf pan was a bit too small and it overflowed, so it wouldn't come out nicely. I made a tiny loaf and that one worked perfectly. Mine took about 50 mins. to bake. I think this is because I guesstimate the amount of pineapple as I only had sliced and popped it into the food processor briefly. Also, my butter was too soft. I will make this again as cakelets as soon as I can. Three picky children, aged 4 to 7, all loved it and THAT is high praise to me."
1481081,268197,2018-11-22,5,"Perfect recipe. I place all of the ingredients in the stainless mixer bowl, stir and freeze for 15 min along with the whipper. This turns out perfect. I frosted a flourless chocolate cake with this and it stood up for 4 days in the fridge."
2002342473,89164,2018-11-21,5,"Very easy bread for a novice! I cut the recipe by 1/2 without any problems. I've been looking for a recipe that can be used to teach friends and grandchildren how to make bread. This recipe was almost too easy! LOL My loaf (2 rounds in a bread pan) came out perfectly. Because it is so simple, we will be using this recipe as our &quot;go to&quot; when the grandchildren are over for the afternoon or when we want fresh hot bread with a meal."
2002342774,17186,2018-11-21,0,I love this recipe! I did add a little more cheese . No need to add salt
2002342572,181756,2018-11-21,5,The best from two cuisines! Even better with curry paste instead of powder.
2002342633,264097,2018-11-21,5,"I was confused by the recipe; then I reread it now and realized the oil had to go in the marinade; I measured 1/4 inch and it was too thin after marination; I think 8 slices is perfect size; also the marination at 1 and 1/2 cups was a lot; but I got through this. there was no oil in the marinade; let it sat for 3 hours; slowly removed each piece and place on a sprayed parchment paper and quickly sprayed lightly (to replace the oil I forgot) with olive oil. I started off at 30 minutes and did it for about 40. OMG it was good. Thank you, because I have to watch my sodium and am tired of processed vegan foods."
2002342672,63071,2018-11-21,5,My children and I love this recipe! I have made this recipe twice and used vegetable oil the first time and avocado oil the second time. I could not tell a difference.
1580637,329676,2018-11-21,3,Was very tasty and moist but as written (with 3/4 tsp baking soda) the cake caved in a bit. I discovered the mistake after adding the soda and tried to correct the problem by adding 3/4 tsp baking powder in addition but the cake still caved. I will try to re-review after I make it again with what was probably the intended ingredient only: baking powder.
2000498330,466782,2018-11-21,5,"Sublime flavor, even more so the next day. Happy tummy."
2002341770,337236,2018-11-21,5,I’ve been using this recipe for a number of years to cook my 24 pound turkey. Turned out great every time. Moist and juicy. I did not tweak the recipe.
2002342273,29912,2018-11-21,0,This recipe is identical to the one I have been making since the 1980s (found it in Bon App&eacute;tit and still have the recipe cut out in my cookbook!). It is delicious and always a hit. Quite rich so I always cut small squares). I like to use pecan halves and arrange them nicely on the top. Time consuming but looks nice!
2002343688,169670,2018-11-21,0,Excellent recipe! I use gold raisins rather than the brown and this is always gobbled up! We do friendsgiving and every year this is the only repeat request!
2002341757,486641,2018-11-21,5,I just made this using walnuts. It turned out excellent. Went just under an hour. Can't wait for my husband to wake up and try some! Next time I will try adding some chocolate chips or blueberries!
2002343938,358622,2018-11-21,4,"I read all of the comments and decided to simmer it on the stove using her original measurments for the water. I used half of the vanilla and added a splash of Allspice powder. I simmered it on the stove and in about five minutes once it started boiling, it was finished. I knew it would be thick enough when I put a cold metal spoon into the syrup and watched it thicken as I stood the spoon upright. Lovely tasting. I made a second batch and instead of using water, I used coffee and OMG D-Lish!!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe!"
2002341722,382537,2018-11-21,5,There are multiple ways to make a dirty margarita. This recipe is one of the best.
2002342147,303245,2018-11-21,5,I usually only eat ribs from the grill during the summer months but I caught a good sale on a slab of St. Louis ribs and couldn’t resist. I seasoned with Rib Rub and followed the directions to the T. Absolutely delicious. I couldn’t stop nibbling on them throughout the night!
2000498330,99748,2018-11-21,4,"After reading reviews, I upped the bacon bits and chives to 4 tablespoons each. Would increase the chives even more. A good hearty bread that is excellent toasted, with a bowl of soup."
2002343504,63517,2018-11-21,5,Easy and delicious!
2002343258,529975,2018-11-21,5,I am addicted to these crackers ! I do not bother with food processor at all and the recipe works fine. I use butter instead of coconut oil. I divide the dough in half and make 2 cookie sheets worth. I like them thin.
2002343768,94421,2018-11-21,5,Did not make any changes. It was perfect.
565041,333333,2018-11-21,5,"I’ve been making boiled/steamed cauliflower pur&eacute;e for a long time. This is SO MUCH BETTER! I used light cream cheese instead of sour cream and added pepper. I roasted the cauliflower and garlic for almost 40 minutes, stirring/flipping every 10 minutes to get an even caramelization. Lovely complex flavor and great texture. I’m making some for Thanksgiving dinner; will put in a small casserole, top with cheese and bake to reheat. Thanks!"
2002342664,339453,2018-11-21,5,"THE perfect turkey and frees up the oven. 3rd year pulling up this recipe. I will now save it! I do stuff the bird as well. FJust as stated don't left lid until time is up, it will most likely be done an hour early. So glad you shared this! I don't use the thermometer but probably not a bad idea..."
2628222,268365,2018-11-21,5,I used to buy the creole seasoning Cajun butter marinade for injecting deep fried turkeys. It became harder and harder to come by. So last year I tried this recipe. It was a hit. I didn’t want to clog the injector with garlic so I used powdered. The taste came out fantastic but it left some grit. So this year I will just jarred minced garlic. Hopefully they’ve had time to soften up and blend easily. Delicious!!
2002343385,317322,2018-11-21,5,I love this crust. Very easy to roll out. I use less water if I can and don’t blend it too much to keep it from seeming tough. I have tried some others and they may seem flakier but a lot of times just crumble. This one works for me and has a great taste.
2002341899,120106,2018-11-21,5,It was delicious! I left out the celery as we aren't really fans. Very good and filling!
2002343837,332272,2018-11-21,5,"My go-to sauce, and easy to make. The sweetness of the mango delights before the bite of the pepper kicks in. Thanks for the recipe!"
2002343040,46780,2018-11-21,5,I made this cheesecake last year it was out of the park all raved about how good it was. Way easier than my old standby pumpkin cheesecake recipe and a lot tastier.
2002342619,40195,2018-11-21,0,I made the johns gourmet pumpkin pie and family adored it one of the best will use this recipe from now on!
2002342586,128094,2018-11-21,5,"While this the current typical (and very good) recipe for Chex Mix, it is hardly the original. Below is the original Life magazine ad from 1952 (image courtesy of Wikipedia). No Corn Chex, they were not introduced until 1958, nor pretzels and certainly no Cheerios, they are a General Mills product. In 1952 Chex was a Ralston Purina product. I love Chex Mix (home made, the store bought one is awful) I wish I could eat it all the time. Alas, time catches up with all of us and the salt and fat are no-no's now. Still, for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays I make up a batch or two and pig out. My secret pleasure, alright, one of my secret pleasures"
2002004080,391323,2018-11-21,5,"This is a great base recipe. Take your best stuffed cabbage roll recipe and season this as you would do with that. Cook the meat and tomato mixture so that it's quite dry when you're done with it. The reason being is that the cabbage will release moisture into the casserole so you want to start off with a fairly dry meat and tomato mixture. tasty meat mixture before you start assembling the casserole because that will give you an idea as to how the overall casserole will taste. I had to cook mine about 20 minutes more to get to the doneness that I prefer. This might be due simply to differences in ovens. Again, great recipe to start with and tweak it to make it your own."
701448,57615,2018-11-21,5,This is a fabulous recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. This soup will be added to my winter arsenal.
2002342317,267289,2018-11-21,2,"I used this technique for baking my turkey for years and years. It was some of the best turkey ever to this day. I didn't read all through the instructions. I read enough to understand this is basically the preparation I used to do. I would take shortening and grease the entire inside of the bag. I didn't sprinkle water on the outside. I did however placed a small half pint mason jar 1/2 full with water place it very carefully inside standing up just before you close the bag. I stopped stapling the bag for fear someone would eat one. The bag gets pretty unstable. I started using clothes pins. They work great! I through them away with the carcass. New ones next year. Then one day I got asked where I got &quot;brand new bags&quot;? What??? Grocery store, where else? The paper bags are now all RECYCLED. Does any one know what the contents of the papers is now??? I now use the plastics baking bags, I get those also at the grocery store. It's fabulous, too. No more paper bags for us! Happy baking!!!"
2002343527,29480,2018-11-21,0,I've been baking bread for almost 60 years and have some great recipes. This isn't one of them.
2001297534,230385,2018-11-21,5,Other than adding red chili pepper flake because we like our food a little spicy I made this recipe as written. I used 80% ground beef. The shredded cheese was a Colby-jack blend. This recipe was easy to make and delicious. I will add this to my make again list. Thanks for sharing.
2002342240,143254,2018-11-21,4,"Love it! Did make a simple glaze from 1 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla, 2 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon milk."
2002343646,271210,2018-11-21,5,"Fairly new to the cooking world, this recipe was super easy to make and follow. First attempt and it tastes amazing!!! I used the advice about adding some broth to the flour butter mixture plus added additional pepper to taste. Thanks for the great recipe!!"
2002338951,29690,2018-11-21,0,"I don't see a place to give this recipe stars, but it deserves at least 6! I made this spicy pork Bulgogi today and it was wonderful! I made it according to the recipe and it turned out as good as the Bulgogi I have had at a very popular Korean restaurant we frequent. It was easy to make, and it was delicious!"
2000761759,26217,2018-11-20,5,"would be nice if this inferior site to &quot;food.com&quot; and &quot;recipezaar&quot; would allow me to edit what I print. I want a one page recipe, not a recipe with a picture that makes it into 2 pages."
2002325761,232372,2018-11-20,5,really good!
2002341034,314869,2018-11-20,5,"I found this recipe in a book several years ago. I had copied it and it had become so faded, I decided to do a search for it. I've tried many pretzel recipes over the years but this is still my favorite. The only exception was that my recipe called for 1/2 c. baking soda in the bath....I reduced that amount to 1/3 c. and like the taste a little better. So glad to find it online!"
2002340793,69983,2018-11-20,5,I've been making this cake for about 30 years! I add 1 t. ginger &amp; 1/2 t. cloves along with the 2 t. cinnamon. (or just use 3 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice). The addition of 1/2 c. chopped pecans is nice and I usually bake in 2-9&quot; round pans for a layer cake.
2002340675,490584,2018-11-20,5,I make these every year for thanksgiving and they are a huge hit! Honestly they’re frustrating to make as they’re a whole lot of work but they taste amazing!
2002339855,161131,2018-11-20,0,DO NOT COOL OUTSIDE OF PAN! First time making a quick bread so this step in the directions completely ruined my loaf and it crumbled all over the place! Ugh.
2002340605,107869,2018-11-20,5,"Moist, delicious and easy. Everyone who tried it loved it!"
2002339871,230909,2018-11-20,5,I love this recipe. I have also substituted dark chocolate chips for milk chocolate chips and peanut butter chips for butterscotch chips. they are also very tasty.
2002340141,391209,2018-11-20,5,First time making risotto and it was a success. Delicious flavors with this recipe. I followed exact and top with sliced garlic butter chicken breast and chopped green onions for garnish. My family loved it and I will definitely be making this again.
2001575254,420289,2018-11-20,5,"My son is vegan, so I was looking for a recipe to make for him. Given that I only had 3 bananas, I added 1/4 cup homemade applesauce. The bit of cinnamon in the applesauce added the perfect touch. Also, I added a few chopped walnuts. He loved it!"
2002164639,133448,2018-11-20,0,Try a heaping tablespoon of you favorite hummus instead of the butter and milk! Ymm!
2002341551,519340,2018-11-20,4,this recipe made 117 cookies... they're so good though
2002134535,17186,2018-11-20,5,"I use this recipe every Thanksgiving and everyone loves it...I have a question...this year I'm making multiple dishes that go in the oven so I may not have room for this, HAS ANYONE EVER TRIED MAKING IN THE SLOW COOKER/CROCK POT? I want to boil the macaroni till al'dente then mix it all together in the slow cooker and cook for about 3 hours...anyone??"
2002316428,441399,2018-11-20,5,"I made this today and it was a huge hit! I started at noon, so cooked on high for about two hours and turned to low the rest of the day. Meat was very tender, flavorful and spicy (but not too spicy)! Entire family loved it. Served with cilantro lime cole slaw and shredded cheddar/monterrey jack cheese on some corn tortillas with rice. Fabulous - will definitely make again!"
2002341036,75074,2018-11-20,0,"This cake is hands down way better than angel food cake, this is so much moister and so good when it's warm with a nice glass of milk. This is one of those recipes that will stay with me for a life time. Thankyou so much for introducing this recipe cause it is AMAZING."
2001843278,20167,2018-11-20,5,Made this recipe with my nephews today for dinner! They had a great time braiding their dough and it tasted delicious.
2001601577,105371,2018-11-20,5,"You can make this recipe gluten free by replacing the wheat flour with cup 4 cup gluten free flour or any higher quality all purpose gluten free flour mix that includes xanthan gum within the mixes ingredients list. If you are making this recipe gluten free add an additional 15 minutes to the baking time as gluten free desserts take longer to bake. I HIGHLY recommend baking these in a light colored silicon mini muffin tray. These also work as mini pecan pies in a regular sized silicon muffin tray, again just increase the baking time. I baked my gluten free mini pecan pies a good 50 minutes due to the larger sized portion. This recipe is very good, it is versatile, it turns out beautifully and it is so very simple to make. It does not disappoint!"
2002340430,339992,2018-11-20,1,Kroger recipe sucks sugar is not added. Tastes nasty. Libby's can recipe is much better. I had to throw away 2 pies because no one could finish off one piece of pie. Not to mention the brick of lead feeling it left you with shortly after eating it.
2002340483,95296,2018-11-20,5,I used this recipe and it was a huge success. I didn't use allspice. The meat was very moist. I highly suggest you try this.
2002340476,440665,2018-11-20,5,"Have been using this recipe for years; it's very easy and very delicious. This is my wife's favorite preparation for brussels sprouts (I prefer roasted with olive oil) so it's the one I prepare most frequently. The sprouts come out tender, but al dente; perfect bites of flavor. The only downside, as for any crock pot sprouts recipe, is it will smell up your house. I bring my cooker to the garage and plug it in there. Also, the color and texture of the dish isn't great if you're going for an impressive visual presentation; sprinkling a garnish on top will help, any green herb suited to the meal works as will bread crumbs."
1052873,492239,2018-11-20,5,I made these as drop cookies. Very yummy!
2000678359,49813,2018-11-20,5,I make this every Thanksgiving and it's a hit. Even with my sister who does not like squash!
2002341559,30965,2018-11-20,5,I use this recipe every time I make chicken and dumplings. They turn out wonderfully every time and are so simple
2002341671,102674,2018-11-20,1,"I made it to step 5, where it tells you use the second 4 ounces (whole stick) of butter before I looked back at the ingredients and realized it meant 4 tablespoons. I dumped my pot of vegetables drowning in butter and found a more trustworthy recipe on a different site."
2002312797,350689,2018-11-20,5,"My mom has made this for years! It's been a family favorite. After making it for my husband, it still is! I love that you don't need all the ingredients such as the peppers or pecans--STILL heavenly! I read the instructions wrong and only used 1 can of the rolls, but it was the perfect amount for the two of us!"
2002340677,231446,2018-11-20,0,This is the BEST Spoon Bread recipe. I believe the sour cream and sugar makes it stand out from all the others. Do NOT put cheese in it like other people do. It ruins it.
2002340094,92021,2018-11-20,5,Name says it all. Amazing burger best I have tasted in ages
242766,379516,2018-11-20,5,"We enjoyed these quick and easy appetizers. They were a perfect munchie to have while watching football. The only thing I did differently was to add 1/2 teaspoon minced, fresh garlic to the cream cheese mixture. Yummy! **Made for 2018 Football Pool**"
1145514,514137,2018-11-20,5,Made this exactly as written and it's officially become one of my family favorites!!!
2002341021,128094,2018-11-20,5,"You all are a hoot! A recipe is guide that you alter to your tastes. However, Lawry's seasonened salt has been around a long time! This used to be called &quot;Nuts and Bolts&quot; because of the cherrios and pretzel sticks. Also, it was 1 cup of peanuts not mixed nuts. I love the oven recipe because it taste the best."
2002294030,87925,2018-11-20,5,"Great recipe, delivers super chocolate flavor as promised. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chips and the brownies came out so much better than using Nestles. The only change we made was the addition of toasted walnut pieces. This has got to be one of the simplest recipes to mix up, just a wooden spoon and a bowl or two."
2002340226,186027,2018-11-20,5,"I used your recipe several months ago with fresh pattypan from my cousins garden, they were small, just right for a serving. I used heavy whipping cream and real butter. Added shrimp. Absolutely delish! I had never cooked these before and ....i'm so glad I picked your awesome recipe! Thank you!"
2002226089,494182,2018-11-20,3,"I just made exact copy. However, It has heavy vinegar smell. I used white vinegar. What is wrong? Does it have to wait lid open for awhile get that smell out?"
2002339889,60958,2018-11-20,4,I have been making this recipe for years! Made it with my momma as a little girl. Make my own bread dough and add a little garlic to the filling and it is amazing!
2002341077,463311,2018-11-20,5,"My husband hates chicken. So I try to come up with different recipes to keep things interesting. I found a similar recipe on the back of his Christmas gift, a multi pack of hot sauces, years ago, used it a couple times but lost the card. I tweaked it just a little. First I add onion powder with the garlic powder. Second, I use a baking tray instead of a dish, to me the dish makes it soggy but the tray allows for it to crisp a little. I line the tray with foil and put parchment paper over it. For my daughter I don't soak her piece in the hot sauce. Easiest way to spread the topping is with an off set frosting knife."
2002338229,2496,2018-11-19,5,"This is so easy to make and honestly the most moist chocolate cake I’ve ever made! It will be my go-to chocolate cake recipe from now on! I did need to cook a few minutes longer than recipe said, but that could have just been my oven. Cook till toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean or nearly clean.."
227652,192894,2018-11-19,5,Wonderful recipe! Nice twist on normal chocolate frosting. Followed recipe exactly----forgot the salt as someone else mentioned!
1185804,63244,2018-11-19,4,I weighed the dough into 10 portions and flattened them to a 1/2 inch round and let them rise. Cooked them in a covered CI skillet over low heat (barely a flame) for 7 minutes per side. I would definitely increase the salt to 3/4 to 1 teaspoon from the 1/2 teaspoon listed in the recipe. Tasted just a little flat. Fork split and they toasted nicely with a light crunch and soft interior.
2002339556,22782,2018-11-19,5,"I've made this twice now with only the slightest tweaks (added a couple teaspoons of &quot;Italian Seasoning&quot; mix from our co-op). It's absolutely perfection. Rich, just spicy enough to add interest, and no acid overload. I'm not a fan of tomato-based sauces, but I love this. So did my husband."
2002266190,107786,2018-11-19,5,The rub was perfect! Used the grill with sweet baby rays bbq to finish off. So so good!
227652,80156,2018-11-19,5,"I made half the recipe just to give it a try before the holiday season. I also tried to read as many reviews as possible! I used a full stick of butter (1/2 cup), and used 2 eggs. I reduced the ginger to 2 tsp as well. I didn't let the dough sit just so I could see how it worked and just in case I am pressed for time in the future. Seemed to work out just fine. I used LOTS of flour and rolled the dough on a Silpat. I also rolled the dough to about 1/2 inch thickness. I didn't have gingerbread men---only a big heart shaped one. I baked mine for 350 for 9 minutes. My spouse said they were great. I look forward to using the gingerbread man cutout."
2002339294,22421,2018-11-19,5,"This is the BEST chocolate chess pie EVER! I’ve made many using different recipes, but probably won’t even try another. Thus recipe is THAT GOOD!"
227652,178370,2018-11-19,5,Followed the recipe pretty much as described. I used jumbo muffin pans and so baked them for 22 minutes at 350. I didn't get to taste them myself as they were for a friend but they looked and smelled as they should. If I get any feedback from her I'll pass it on.
2002338242,486641,2018-11-19,5,Very moist and delicious!
2002339484,38298,2018-11-19,0,"So I just finished making this for the second time - this is such a great recipe. Didnt tweak the actual recipe - just the order and technique. First I cooked the bacon. I used the same pan (and bacon grease) to cook the sausage and onions. I did each item separately because I wanted to carmelize the onions. Lastly I lightly roasted the garlic. I let the chicken broth boil - added two tsp of flour- and then added the cooked onions, potatoes, and that’s also when I chose to add 2 tsp of roasted red pepper flakes. (I love spice) Those took about 30 minutes to cook on a medium heat setting. When those were soft I added the sausage, bacon, and kale. Tempered in my heavy cream. And y’all this is just so good. So so good. Will be making this recipe forever."
2001297534,293219,2018-11-19,5,"I made this recipe for a small social gathering. I used 4 Big Jim Green Chilis that were roasted, peeled, deseeded and chopped. The cheese blend I used was shredded Colby-jack. I also added sliced black olives. The results were a good tasting bean dip that quickly disappeared. Thanks for sharing."
2002339464,178370,2018-11-19,0,i loved this recipe! the cupcakes were amazing!
2002180927,131607,2018-11-19,5,Excellent and Easy!!
2002338994,139499,2018-11-19,5,"This is an excellent recipe. However, I did find the orange flavor was very subtle and, to compensate for this, I add a generous amount of orange rind, probably 3 tsp. or more."
2002338774,79506,2018-11-19,5,"Great recipe. Buuuuttt...TIP: switch the steps. 1) Beat the whip cream and powder sugar until slightly thick, place in the fridge. 2) Dissolve gelatin in cold water, then place over heat until slightly thickened 3) Cool SLIGHTLY (maybe 2 minutes otherwise it will thicken too much and be unusable) 4) Get whip cream, attach bowl to your mixer stand and turn on your mixer, quickly incorporating your cooled gelatin into the whipped until the whip cream forms stiff peaks. 5) DONE! www.kupkakefairy.com"
2002339733,58823,2018-11-19,5,"Quick and easy. I used 2 lbs of polish kielbasa I added one can of pink beans in addition to a can of cannolini beans, sliced mushrooms- a couple of tablespoons of Peter Luger steak sauce, a couple of shakes of worcestershire, a sprinkle of light brown sugar and I used a can of diced tomatoes that had jalape&ntilde;os because that’s what I had on hand. Yummy! Would never have thought to do beans with kielbasa. Thanks!"
2002339051,349246,2018-11-19,1,"Yuck! Neither texture nor taste were very good. I wish I could do 0/5 stars. I tried to salvage it with some more milk (about another tablespoon) and that fixed the texture problem, but I could not get over the taste. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone!"
2000157513,196153,2018-11-19,5,"Great recipe! I need to divulge my tweaks, since I read the reviews. I left out the garlic powder and added one bag of roasted garlic cloves - maybe 8 or 10 chopped cloves. I used half the butter and double the water, as some others suggested. I didn't measure the salt or pepper, but pretty sure it was less than some added, as they had reviewed that it was too salty. I figured I could always add more at the end. But, I cooked the potatoes for 4 hours on high. I removed 1/2 cup of water (I'd added an extra cup). I ended up using only 1/2 cup milk and mashed by hand. The potatoes were wonderful! The flavoring is dictated by the amounts and types of garlic, butter, salt, and pepper you use. Adjust those to your preferences. However, the process design of using the crockpot... sheer brilliance. I no longer have to worry about boiling at the last moment or mashing even later. I can let the crockpot do the work, mash early, and work on other stuff. Thank you Vseward Chef-V"
2002339682,377628,2018-11-19,5,These turned out great! I added some chia and sesame seeds. Topped with Himalayan salt and cracked pepper. I did lower oven to 250 and baked a bit longer. Very adaptable to ingredients around the house. I love that they are low carb crunchy snack for cheese or salad topper. They do turn a dark brown in color. My husband thought I had burned these like everything else I aggressively bake but not this one time ??
2002338645,2886,2018-11-19,5,So amazing! This perfectly yielded 12 banana muffins! I used brown sugar in place of granulated and I probably would melt the butter next time. But 10/10! Very delicious and very very moist!
2002338680,231701,2018-11-19,1,"This was the worst Peanut butter fudge recipe I have ever tried, this was a waste of ingredients. It just turned to powder in the pan"
2002338430,147559,2018-11-19,0,Don”t make this recipe. There is clearly an error. Way too much liquid for flour!!! Fix it please.
2002339807,3748,2018-11-19,5,"I have used this recipe for years, when I moved across the country from Arkansas to Southern California, I lost my favorite box of recipes, I was so excited to run across it here on this website thank you. When the kids where little I used to cook sausage and bacon with the leftovers I would make this with the leftovers and add shredded sharp cheese or whatever I had on hand and they really ate the bread and asked for more Then I made some for Santa Claus and had to each year and now going to do so for my grandkids hope ya'll enjoy this variation"
2000211897,39507,2018-11-19,1,Good NY cheesecakes don't have a crust. And they certainly have a lot more than one 8 oz. package of cream cheese. And they're baked for hours! This sounds terrible- like blob of runny white jello! Yuk!!!
2002339251,372087,2018-11-19,1,wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to much butter! it turned into a giant crusty thin pizza mess!
2002339812,101954,2018-11-19,5,"Loved this recipe. I used light corn syrup, half white sugar and half brown sugar, 2 tsp cornstarch and a pinch of salt."
2002338425,358622,2018-11-19,4,Totally out of syrup says my husband?! Never fear recipes on the net are here. Quick &amp; Good Flavor Syrup Recipe I was thinking 1C Brown Sugar 1C White Sugar To fix thickness prob?? ?Let ya know!

2002338686,166716,2018-11-19,5,I thought this was going to weird but it was actually delicious. My family loved it too.
2002338514,27204,2018-11-19,0,"This was hands down the worst meal ever. The meat tasted so strange (sirloin), I rinsed it thoroughly. Couldn’t even taste the sour cream at all. Was watery. I scowl when I read bad reviews because I think they’re unbecoming, but rest assured you’d be better off...cooking down your onion, garlic, and mushrooms, quick sear your sirloin in cast iron skillet, adding a packet of stroganoff mix, a bit of white wine, and double the amount of sour cream that’s suggested on packet. Salt and pepper to taste. I never cook with packets or canned soup, but with stroganoff it is really good. I was horribly disappointed."
2002338885,375428,2018-11-19,0,Thank you so much for sharing your recipe! I can't wait to make this.
2002318012,425979,2018-11-19,5,"Much thanks for the recipe. Successful first time with a couple modifications (due to supply limitation): Substituted molasses with honey and skipped cocoa / caraway; didn't have enough bread flour, so the ratio was 1.75 bread / 1.75 rye. It worked great and yes slightly sweeter, but it tasted fine in a strong flavored rye bread."
2002261394,150627,2018-11-19,0,"It is tasty, and almost a word for word copy of the same recipe from William Sonoma. I really hope that Karen from Colorado was the original creator of this, and isn't trying to pass someone else's recipe off as her own. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.williams-sonoma.com/m/recipe/baked-ham-with-a-brown-sugar-rum-and-cayenne-glaze.amp.html"

2001513060,36561,2018-11-18,5,"Delicious recipe!!!! My hubby and I were so very pleased. Took leftovers to his restaurant to share. I used bok choy, rainbow carrots, red bell pepper, fresh mushrooms, celery &amp; green onions. Very pretty dish. I chose to serve it over spaghetti noodles, which I had stirred in sesame oil, soy sauce and black sesame seeds"
2000174211,2886,2018-11-18,5,"I made this last week for my granddaughters and they absolutely loved it. They wanted to eat it for breakfast, school snack and dessert. It is the best banana bread recipe."
1564587,406380,2018-11-18,5,Made exactly as written
318225,111231,2018-11-18,5,Excellent recipe. I doubled the recipe for a large gathering. Everyone loved it. I didn't change a thing except omitting the olives.
2002337577,145038,2018-11-18,1,"This recipe ruined my baking pan! I'm now left with scrubbing the caked mix of honey, olive oil, soy sauce off of my pan!"
2002337783,101954,2018-11-18,5,Delicious! Thought pie wasn’t done at 45 min because it was still jiggly but took it out anyways and after a few min it set up beautifully! Definitely a keeper :)
2001818421,278583,2018-11-18,5,We have eaten this for many years! The only difference is that we add crushed pineapple to the mixture. You just have to drain the pineapple very well! Its always a favorite at our house! The pineapple just adds a bit of texture to the sweet potatoes.
2002337493,2886,2018-11-18,0,I made this and added pecans and used a teaspoon of vanilla. This is my favorite banana bread. The best when warm.
2002336974,498738,2018-11-18,5,I brought these to a Thanksgiving dinner last night and they were a big hit. Simple to make and delicious!
2002337522,44115,2018-11-18,5,These were better than the French's onions and easy to make with ingredients we all should have at home. Can't wait to make my green bean casserole with these. My house smells amazing.
2002338130,607,2018-11-18,5,"I downloaded this recipe in 2011, but never made it until today. Silly me, it was delicious! I only had a #3lb. bag of onions on hand, so I used that and 5 cans of beef broth. Also added Better than Bouillion with the flour/broth mixture. It's just me and my husband, so I will freeze the remaining for another meal. Also, I thought it odd to simmer for 2 hours after adding the broth, but it really is one of the most important steps! If you follow the recipe EXACTLY, it won't disappoint!"
2001865410,277862,2018-11-18,5,"Hot, flavorful. This is a fantastic recipe. If you miss New Mexico or love New Mexico or want to come on down to flavor town; make it."
2002336710,44115,2018-11-18,5,Found this recipe and wanted to try it because these things are so ridiculously overpriced at the grocery store. They turned out SO GOOD that it's hard to stop eating them. I'm going to add what's left of them to a yummy spinach casserole tomorrow. Thank you!!
2002337492,148951,2018-11-18,0,"I built them first, after in the oven 3 minutes, 350, Used same size pan with parchment paper underneath, pressed down a little. Came out perfect. Sturdy hands!"
2002337503,182624,2018-11-18,0,Don’t ever attemp to make this Done everything according to directions and fudge ended up runny and we know what the results will be HOMEMADE TAFFY instead of fudge Very disappointed
2002337416,533950,2018-11-18,5,"Was so good! I used Maple bacon, and everyone loved it. The bacon wasn't soggy, so it was good too. I did put a very loose sheet of foil over top so bacon wouldn't get too done. Worked great!! Will do this again!!"
2002337831,517313,2018-11-18,5,"The nutrition guide would be mandatory for me, since my husband is diabetic and needs to could carbs for all meals."
2001963796,37081,2018-11-18,5,"This was so easy to make and so delicious! I love seafood and have never had a lobster roll...i’m a huge fan. i added lemon juice, about a teaspoon’s worth, and some melted butter (since i accidentally melted mine to put on the buns) and it really enhanced the flavor of the lobster. super delicious and easy tho!"
1803283526,305912,2018-11-18,5,I have served this salad on many occasions &amp; family and friends always comment on how delicious this grape salad is. I've shared this recipe many times &amp; I make it just as it's written and it's always good. The cream cheese sauce is delicious when it's added to mixed berries as well. This is a never fail recipe.
2002338165,393411,2018-11-18,4,"Very yummy bread! I made a couple changes: I used Bob's Red Mill 1-1 Gluten Free flour and I added some cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg for added flavor since I didn't have pumpkin spice blend. Took almost 90 mins to bake but well worth it. Even my gluten-eating husband liked it. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!"
2000337177,37352,2018-11-18,1,"The only thing I could taste was mayo and jalapeno, after it sat overnight. I will just get some things at the store and recreate it myself. I know the original had Monterrey jack or pepper jack as an ingredient (I worked at one when it came out years ago). This tastes nothing like it. If I do recreate it I will share the recipe"
2002336592,278956,2018-11-18,0,My Sweetheart &amp; I use Worcestershire a lot! Thank God for this recipe! I'm never going to buy it again. This is sooo much better! I was out of garlic powder &amp; just used some minced garlic juice. Still awesome! Thank you! My Sweetheart is also impressed that I make it since he's the chef!
2001625595,125382,2018-11-18,5,"I just love this recipe and make it every couple of weeks during the fall/winter. I like the recipe as written, but I often sub 1/2 c. brown sugar for the sugar. Thank you for this great recipe!"
2002337220,67930,2018-11-18,5,"I made these this morning. I used a can of evaporated milk in place of regular milk, used half a can of pumpkin puree, added a teaspoon of vanilla as well as a splash of rum. I also sifted my dry ingredients. The batter was not liquidy at all. Used approximately one cup of batter for my Belgian waffle iron. Came out crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. My husband said they were the best pumpkin waffles he has ever had. :-)"
767591,44692,2018-11-18,5,I've used this recipe several years now.. It's really good. I substitute herb seasoned stuffing for the bread and add more broth. My family isn't crazy about sage so I use half of the recommended.
2002337097,420289,2018-11-18,5,"This is the best vegan banana bread I have made so far. I made it as is, lovely. I will add this one to my repertoire. ?? Tried to add a photo but it wouldn't work. Sorry!"
2002337566,198673,2018-11-18,3,"Consumers: one loved it and several praised it. Some had second and third servings. I'm picky. Cons: To me, this was a generically sweet dessert I could not taste the persimmon the spices were too strong &amp; dominated the dish Pros: texture was lovely not too oily the high level of sugar gave the top edges a lovely crispness I think to improve this I'd cut the nutmeg &amp; cloves and lessen the sugar (maybe sprinkle some on top for the crisp feeling,) and possibly add some persimmon (but then you'd have to mess with the moisture to accommodate.) Also, I like to add a little lemon zest to fruity desserts - it doesn't overrule the main fruit flavor."
2002035951,35392,2018-11-18,5,"Personally, I love this recipe. I have used it in so many ways, baking it in the oven with a homemade apple pie mix, adding nutmeg, cinnamon, sugar to it. Makes a great quick substitute using it for strawberry shortcake adding homemade caramel sauce, whip cream. Lots of desert, and meal ideas with bannock. Can be substituted instead of bisquits for corn chowder our seafood chowder. Mmmm lots and lots of ways to do this. My favorite is homemade apple pie mix in it, make a second batch for a lid. Roll it out on a cookie sheet. Bake it in the oven. Mmmm add ice cream topping after it comes out. P.S. makes a great substitute for pizza crust. Literally try it my kids absolutely love it with invention or even the way it is."
2002267250,185445,2018-11-18,5,"This cookie recipe is DELICIOUSLY PERFECT! I made it EXACTLY as the recipe instructed and it turned out fantastic! The cookie itself was exactly as I hoped—tender, cakelike consistency and perfectly flavored. The icing was over the top scrumptious! Yes, it’s sweet-but it goes perfectly with this cookie. And like someone else said-it’s even tastier the next day—like the flavors meld. Please, make this recipe EXACTLY as directed first, and review it. Otherwise, you’re not reviewing THIS recipe—your reviewing your own version-and that’s not fair to the author. You can always post your own version for review. This cookie doesn’t disappoint. Great job Sara in FL!!!!"
2002335352,155118,2018-11-17,3,"I really liked the idea of this dressing. My deceased aunt had the best oyster dressing and would never share the recipe. Overall, good flavor but cut back on the salt, add some fat like butter and egg. Add some stock for some added flavor. I added extra evaporated milk, and that helped but needs stock (moisture and flavor). And lastly, I like my onions and celery, soft not crunchy. I'll saute in the needed fat (butter or oil) and then add to the bread. Has anyone made this with fresh oysters?"
1029096,102073,2018-11-17,5,"I don't add the cloves, but otherwise, I follow exactly. EXCELLENT, coming from one who's never been big on pumpkin pie. The spice combination as well as the lighter texture makes this the ONLY pumpkin pie I will make. THANK YOU!"
2002334977,2886,2018-11-17,5,I’ve made this banana bread many times and it is absolutely delicious. The only change I make is to add some coconut to it. It adds moisture and a hint of “what is that taste?”. One of my friends claims he’s a connoisseur of banana bread and said this was the best he’d ever had.
2002335396,31750,2018-11-17,5,"This is perhaps the best waffle recipe I have come across, made these this morning, turned out perfect. I did run out of all purpose flour substituted a little cake flour and added a hint of vanilla. Perfect, thanks for sharing."
1424495,19069,2018-11-17,5,delicious and so pretty. I did add more like a tablespoon of beer. Such a simple appetizer to make. I served it with flat pretzels and crackers.
2002295280,72321,2018-11-17,5,"One of my beast dishes forever. I made it two times but didn't get the proper taste. After that when I follow your article really I have got a new flavor, that really impressed to me. Especially thanks to introducing this authentic dish with us Kadai Chicken"
2002334960,324665,2018-11-17,4,Should have read the reviews! A little too salty and we like salt!
163077,243729,2018-11-17,5,This was so quick and easy. Made a great Saturday night dinner.
2000527163,347422,2018-11-17,5,"Made this years ago and couldn't find the recipe. Found!! It is excellent, easy and everyone loved it. Perfect for holiday mornings!"
2002336244,272414,2018-11-17,5,"I've made this recipe in the past, and I've been searching the Internet everywhere for it. This was the first turkey brine recipe I've ever used and it turned out so well, I don't want to try another recipe!"
2001879142,520968,2018-11-17,1,"i do not understand this at all! a literal disaster! I found another recipe that called for self rising flour vs ap so I wonder if this was a misprint. Something is definately wrong with this recipe! No flavor, blonde, salt bomb..."
2002336330,19424,2018-11-17,5,"Is near Christmas and so I decided to add a twist to these muffins with Christmassy decorations and sprinkles. Also, when you're in my kitchen there is always more, and always more chocolate. I like this recipe because it is simple and easy, if you know what you are doing."
2002335061,1356,2018-11-17,5,"This is a huge hit with my son (I made four...he ate all four...). But I didn't have any worcesteshire sauce, so I tried fish sauce...which apparently worked as well! I tarted it up with some bacon as suggested by another reader, and added in the chopped tops of the peppers to the meat. This is now officially in rotation."
2002335312,14979,2018-11-17,5,"I have never written a recipe review but after reading some, I felt like I should! It was extremely important to me to find the perfect old fashioned banana cream pie recipe for thanksgiving. My in-laws lost their Nana who usually made the Thanksgiving pies, and I felt I should step up! I loved the 5 star rating but honestly I got scared when I read reviews saying it was “too runny” or “too much” or “I changed this or that.” I made my practice pie yesterday. I followed the recipe step by step precisely. It came out PERFECT! Not too runny, not too anything. I felt like it made the perfect amount for my Pyrex pie dish. I think the issue people are having with it being runny is the scalded milk. You can not heat it above 215 degrees F, 180 is the goal, use a candy thermometer! Anyways this recipe is one I will come back to for various cream pies!!"
2002335517,49534,2018-11-17,5,"These are incredible! Whenever I have to bring treats to a social thing, these are my go-to. The trick is to make them small and not overcook them. They are so cute and soft, a perfect crowd pleaser. And on the days when I’ve been all out of butter, I’ve used coconut oil and they turned out beautifully. Definitely worth the 5 stars!"
2002335279,2886,2018-11-17,5,"I love this recipe. It's very easy. I tried it the 1st time with 4 bananas but it didn't bake all the way through, even with extra time. The flavor was awesome but gooey. The next time I tried it with the 3 bananas and it's perfect. I also doubled the vanilla extract. Took a loaf to the office and it was gone in seconds. This is a great recipe and will use often."
2002320668,268753,2018-11-17,3,It came out fine and tastes good. But I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was very dry. I had to add about half a cup of milk to get it all mixed in. The texture is still a little hard but overall good. I would add photos as I baked them in a mold but don't know how. They look beautiful though.
2002335761,54273,2018-11-17,5,Have made this MANY times. Always a BIG hit. My husbands favorite dessert. It is very rich tho so small servings are the best. Should refridgerate overnight for best results.
2002335039,318691,2018-11-17,5,"Used raw sugar and apple cider vinegar. And orange, red, and purple peppers and a few peppercorns. Also added a garlic clove to each jar. Wonderful!"
79636,72219,2018-11-17,5,great tasting stuffing especially with bacon. Husband like this. I had to take out the butter. Since that is dairy. You can't tell the difference.
227652,248020,2018-11-17,5,Wonderful recipe! Next time I'll use more cinnamon (personal preference). Delicious and easy to make!
2002335281,303245,2018-11-17,5,"I'm making this recipe again tonight for a family dinner. I follow the recipe as written. Last time I made these ribs, my family raved about how delicious were, so everyone is excited to have them again. We buy the Costco St. Louis style ribs and they come out just perfect with this recipe. And I love that it's so simple with very little fuss. Thanks!!"
2002335011,38953,2018-11-17,5,"Wow!! This is the best recipe I’ve come across on the entire internet!! It’s moist, soft, and is just bursting with flavour not to mention easy to make!! I added a half teaspoon of poppyseeds and the loaf was absolutely divine. I made this over 5 times in one month and it never dissapoints! Go do yourself a flavour and make this!!!"
2002336384,162213,2018-11-17,2,"The flour/butter/sugar ratio is not good in this recipe. The cookies have a floury rather than rich taste. Here's a much better recipe from The New Complete Book of Mexican Cooking: 1 cup flour; 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar; 1 cup unsalted butter; pinch of salt; 1 cup pecans, finely chopped; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Also the baking time is very different--350 degree F oven for 30 minutes, not such a high heat for a short time so you avoid the overly brown bottom problem."
2002335608,271829,2018-11-17,5,"I tried this for the first time last night and I love it. I used a large pyrex bowl and heat safe spatulas. Yes the bowl gets HOT, she warns you of that in the recipe. Use oven mits to handle. I used the 3 min process and it turned out So well, I made 3 batches of different flavors in less time than I ever imagined. I usually only get thru one batch as it's so time consuming I don't want to make more. Thank you for the recipe! My next adventure is microwave peanut brittle!"
2002336045,98273,2018-11-17,5,This was my first time making brownies from scratch as I've always just bought the boxed mix.... I read a lot of reviews before making these brownies and wow they are amazingly delicious! ... Most of the reviewers said the brownies came out cake like... Mine did not I baked them for 22min they are good def not cake like brownies.... I followed the recipe as is and I used regular nesquick chocolate milk mix I did take the advice from other reviews n added a little more.... I also used shedd's spread country crock calcium tub of butter as its all I had on hand... I measured 3/4 cup out melted it in the microwave and then stirred it up then added it in.... I made these last night n my family ate half the pan.... What's nice its def a chocolate lovers brownie but its not too rich of a flavor its perfect and so freaking easy to make... Next time ill be adding in some peanut butter.... Thank you for sharing your recipe ... These brownies are delicious and I'll be making these again
2002336085,99966,2018-11-17,5,"NOTE For sourdough starters that feed with potato flakes and sugar (Texas altitude): use 5 cups of flour instead of 3-4 cups. Used all white unbleached flour and all white sugar. Dough is very sticky. I used bread machine on dough setting for knead and 1st rise. Pinched off balls and placed them in greased glass bakeware. Ended up with 20 huge rolls - filled one 9x13 and one 8x8. Light fluffy heavenly rolls. EXCELLENT recipe, OUTSTANDING flavor!!! My friends say I should sell them. They're *That* good y'all. :)"
1800064947,59776,2018-11-17,5,Ruined our ‘let’s try this rib place’...hard to find in the northeast. Fam asks for this recipe weekly! As a dietitian I make them every few months and yes reduce the salt. Usually do not have whiskey around??
2002336037,38298,2018-11-17,5,"My husband and I love this recipe, it's hearty enough for him and fresh enough for me and super easy to make! I used Aldi's &quot;Never Any! Mild Chicken Italian Sausage&quot; and it was just spicy enough."
2001297534,537485,2018-11-17,5,I made this recipe as written. It was easy to put together and was quite tasty. Thanks for sharing.
2002333914,420926,2018-11-16,5,"This was so easy. The mayo Made the breading stick perfectly without it glooping all over like egg does. I seasoned with garlic salt, oregano, a shake of cumin, paprika and white pepper. So good and so easy."
2002334744,392476,2018-11-16,1,"Yesterday, I smoked two 1/2 turkey breasts at the same time in my smokin tex smoker. One was using this recipe, and the other required brining in apple cider with salt, sugar and more. This recipe was simpler, easier, cheaper, and less time consuming during preparation. The result, when we had smoked turkey breast, mayo, cranberry sauce sandwiches on sour dough, both my wife and I agreed that this version tasted better. Today, when the meat was filleted off the ribs, we could not tell the difference - both were excellent. We will go with the easier and cheaper recipe. Thanks. Dave in Portland"
2002334337,449227,2018-11-16,1,Im quite dissapointed as i just made this to a tee. Total cook and prep time was about an hour and it tasted nothing like Panera Bread Souffle. I will definitely be looking for another recipe.
2000728375,330437,2018-11-16,4,"Delicious. I followed other reviewers advice and cut sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Still plenty sweet. Also added 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Skipped the topping (just messy when you eat it and more sugar). Still really liked it. Good use for excess apples from my trees. Next time will add walnuts. Could also see pecans, raisins, coconut etc. ."
2002334716,100513,2018-11-16,5,I made this almost as written. I reduced the sugar to half a cup and added half a cup of dried cranberries. 50 minutes in my convection oven. It's wonderful!! I will be making this again.
2002334719,47111,2018-11-16,5,Wow...this bread turned out wonderful...I am so happy with this easy and simple to follow recipe....thank you again....is there any way you can convert this to low carb? Thank you for your time...Happy Holidays !
2002082373,309834,2018-11-16,0,As an amateur bread maker this recipe was heaven for me... And it looks beautiful. I'm planning to put it on the bread plate for thanksgiving!
2002333891,178526,2018-11-16,4,"This is a great way to make multiple grilled cheese sandwiches at the same time. My family loves mayo, so both slices of each were smeared with Hellman's. They also love cheese, so a heap of shredded Colby jack replaced the second slice of Kraft sharp cheddar. The ten-year-old felt the crust was too hard since we tried it with a thick Brunswick stew. He later agreed that if we had our normal tomato soup, the dipping would soften any hard edges. I think some butter on the sides of the bread slices may make the true difference. Overall, this is an efficient way to make grilled cheese."
2002333894,280743,2018-11-16,5,I have tried this recipe in the past and it was delicious. The 2nd time around I added chicken gravy instead of the soup and it was even better! Kids and husband absolutely love this dish.
329671,506583,2018-11-16,5,"I have made this soup many times. It's awesome. I have to leave out tomatoes and some spices, due to allergies, but it is still delicious."
672534,273737,2018-11-16,5,"Yumm. The flavors are surprising and spicy in a good way. Preparation was easy. I did use my kitchen scale to measure the ingredients specified by weight. My pineapple was what I would call normal size, not small, and it was just 2 slices larger than needed for the recipe. I ate a slice and put the other into the recipe. Word to the wise - I put the draining pineapple (after cooking) over a bowl and captured the excess liquid. When the cooking syrup was just right, I put that into it, and it was no longer just right, so I had to cook the syrup a bit longer to get it back to the right consistency. For those who don't know, &quot;au nape&quot; (should be spelled au nappe) means syrup/sauce consistency-not too thick, not too thin."
2002334148,146339,2018-11-16,5,We LOVED this. I have diabetes so I used MonkFruit brown sugar and it was delicious. I’ve done a similar recipe with Swerve and the monkfruit was clearly the best. Hubby still talking about how good this was next morning.
2000995431,342294,2018-11-16,5,"I've been making this chili for several years. I've made it for church, work, family and my motorcycle club. It's always a big hit. Not too spicy, not too mild. I only made one change. My pastor and several other members don't eat beef, so I use ground turkey instead. Great recipe!"
2002334641,372243,2018-11-16,5,"This recipe made my wife appreciate rye bread. I have to watch my carbs, so I sliced the second loaf into thin sliced and made seasoned rye chips. The sweet molasses in the bread is a wonderful counterpoint to the salt and spices."
885024,102833,2018-11-16,5,i have used this recipe for the last few years. it is excellent!
731982,358768,2018-11-16,5,"This recipe is the bomb! Solo good! I omitted the black olives as hubby doesn't like them and instead if tomato sauce I use my homemade spaghetti sauce but otherwise I stuck to the recipe. If you add a quarter cup of vodka, you will have Vodka Riggies. So good! Sprinkle with a good parmesan or Romano cheese and enjoy!"
2002334816,54257,2018-11-16,5,"I thought this recipe was amazing all on its own, I didn't tweak one thing. I mean what's the use of a recipe if your just going to change everything that makes it awesome on its own..."
2000388554,317078,2018-11-16,5,I have made this several times and it is better than take out and easy to make! My son asked me to make this again tonight and that reminded me to write a review. lol This is definitely a keeper!
2002331093,388066,2018-11-16,1,"I followed this to the letter, and it did not set up very well after cooling 1 hr, despite using a shallow dish...looks like I could of cut recipe in half and used 2 old pie tins, like what is shown in the pictures. Had to throw it out, not a very reliable recipe..."
2002334280,438883,2018-11-16,4,"It tasted very close to the real thing. My kids always pick out the celery and onion in Panera's so I omitted those and added corn instead. They loved it! If I were to make it again, I would only use 1 stick of butter. It was a bit too buttery for me."
578134,22274,2018-11-16,4,Have made these twice now &amp; will be putting them into regular rotation. They are quite a tender pancake with good flavour. Love them with syrup but found them equally good with just a bit of butter. Was out of blueberries the first time I made them so used frozen raspberries &amp; that worked out very nicely too.
2002334142,13123,2018-11-16,5,"I grew up eating at that del rancho. We lived on 42nd and Agnew, we ate there every week!! Made this dressing (been looking for years by the way) It tastes like home. Ty so much for sharing. God bless"
2000649057,209601,2018-11-16,5,You can leave the skins on and blend instead of throwing them away (lots of fibre and nutrition in the skins)... less work too :)
226066,114575,2018-11-15,5,This cake was amazing!! Everyone loved it! I made the recipe as is and it was a hit!
2002124999,123111,2018-11-15,5,Fabulous recipe. I have shared it with all my cooking buddies. I use it in my apricot/ginger/pecan Christmas cake recipe.
2001246894,54029,2018-11-15,5,"I had never had polenta before, but since I never met a corn product I didn't love, I ordered some medium ground polenta on line, and made this recipe, halved exactly as written. O...M...G!!! This came out exactly as advertised. It was smooth, creamy, soft, with a silly mouth feel. My husband loved it, too. I fried up the left overs the next day, and they were great, too. Next time I made it, same result. Fantastic recipe. I do not recommend altering the fat or preparation at all. Otherwise, go for a slower recipe with other liquids."
2002333660,447254,2018-11-15,5,This was DELICIOUS! and so easy. Chicken came out very moist but cooked. I will make this over and over again. I cut recipe in 1/2 and did not pour all the extra cheese over the chicken before I baked (missed that step). Served with a salad.
2002332734,512030,2018-11-15,5,"This gravy is fab. I used home-made stock and seasoned it with about 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. It would be a fab quick-cook gravy for Thanksgiving. For tonight, after I saw how good it was, I cut/ground up a hot and a sweet cased sausage, and added it after the gravy was made. It is obscene. Spoon/bowl obscene."
1803177246,261008,2018-11-15,5,Delish! Very flavorful and has a little zip to it. Have made it 2x in past 2 weeks. Very easy and hubby loved it!
2002333222,345089,2018-11-15,5,Absolutely love this recipe! Simple easy to follow instructions. One of our family favorites for the holidays! Great for those following Keto lifestyle (use coconut or almond flour) I Have shared this recipe with quite a few family and friends! You won't be disappointed!??
2001605835,453806,2018-11-15,5,"So good! I made 4 so the cake element would just be enough to cover my husband's favorite part, the butter/brown sugar/pineapple topping. Worked great, better on day 2."
2002332826,221162,2018-11-15,5,"Have made this recipe for over 20 years, passed down. Most requested side dish for Thanksgiving and potluck dinners. Easy to double up because you will need it if you have a large family or social gathering. No leftovers. Gone. Sometimes I wonder if the dish is licked clean. Ewww! I use half and half, and Ritz crackers. This recipe is rich in taste."
2002332733,5170,2018-11-15,5,Absolutely delicious! Made the pancakes exactly as the recipe calls for. They came out fluffy and soooo good. My go-to recipe for pancakes now!
2002138163,427438,2018-11-15,0,I've been enjoying this for years as a side dish for any kind of fish prepared any way. I add freshly toasted pine nuts or sliced almonds. The parsley isn't absolutely necessary but does boost the flavor if you have it.
2002333665,135350,2018-11-15,5,"This is my go-to mac and cheese recipe with some minor tweaks. First, I add Coleman's mustard powder and paprika in the same amount as the salt. I also use finely shredded Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar. I've done it without breadcrumbs, as well as with regular, and even panko buttered breadcrumbs. The flavor is amazing."
2002279937,454971,2018-11-15,5,"This is very tasty, Its really good with white chicken chili."
2002333578,83624,2018-11-15,1,I'm no stranger to stir fries and often make my own recipes but in pinch I made this as stated and it was horribly salty. I should have known when I noticed 1/2 C of Soya Sauce. Would not recommend.
2002333472,60350,2018-11-15,5,My SUPER picky 12 year old LOVES this recipe! He actually requests it! I sometimes add some chopped cooked bacon for me and my husband. Delicious everytime!
2001035295,322155,2018-11-15,5,This is a wonderful recipe although I only use half a cup of Splenda and about 1-1/2 Tableoons butter. Yum!
2000498330,116444,2018-11-15,4,"Overall a good pizza. The chicken was robustly flavored. The sauce was a little tart, so might add a small amount of sugar to the sauce. Fun to try something different."
2000766501,489757,2018-11-15,5,I have made this several times and it is a hit with all 4 of my boys and that is hard to do! It is delicious!!
2002333496,533150,2018-11-15,5,"Breadman Ultimate machine. Used flax milk and 3/4 almond flour(no wheat).. Goofed and mixed all the dry ingredients together instead of putting salt and sugar in the liquids, but it still rose perfectly on 2# setting light crust. Very good bread recipe for KETO."
2002219164,2886,2018-11-15,5,Made this before and great! I add a streusel topping to mine before baking ?? Have loaf in oven as we speak!
1782877,107786,2018-11-15,5,"I make this all the time, it's delicious and easy! Sometimes I reduce the brown sugar a tad but mostly follow the recipe."
314498,142560,2018-11-15,5,"This was a very easy, quick meal. Loved the flavor. Since I'm not an olive fan I made a slight change. Instead of the olives, olive oil, olive brine and salt, I used Kraft's Greek Vinaigrette dressing. Worked out great. Will definitely make again."
2002046943,2886,2018-11-15,5,Love this recipe because it's SUPER EASY!!!
2002332902,431399,2018-11-15,1,"Probably the worst sugar cookies I’ve ever made in my life. And I stuck to the recipe. I do not recommend! I decided to put powder sugar on top, to cover up the air bubbles and cracks."
1338684,455629,2018-11-15,5,"I was searching high and low for a caffeine-free hot drink I could make (with ingredients I had on-hand) at home before bed, and on cold winter afternoons to warm up. This is going in my recipe book...It was delicious! I can't wait to make it again, and experiment with different milks. Thanks for sharing!"
489929,387068,2018-11-15,5,Made 9 discs as is. I used a blender to mix. Now whenever we run out of bread and have a craving we will go to this. Didn't dip or add anything just ate as is. Everyone loved it!
2002295156,119373,2018-11-15,0,Not bad but some dont like it as salty. Ive found a good guide at https://travelerinfohub.com/how-to-make-sushi-rice/
2002333123,396283,2018-11-15,5,"This really is a great seitan recipe. It has a ton of flavor and the lemon zest really pops. The first time I made it, I used it as chicken in a piccata. I am making it again with lime zest, this time I plan on slicing it for fajitas. There is no temperature listed for the oven. I have been making it on 375&deg; and that seems to be perfect!"
2002333076,75061,2018-11-15,0,"Love this bread. I've tried several recipes for White Bread, this is definitely my favorite to date."
2002142828,537323,2018-11-14,0,"These are amazing! Do yourself a favor and make these little &quot;green bean muffins&quot;. They are easy, delicious, and are showstoppers. I ate two leftover biscuits for breakfast the next day: they heat up beautifully in the microwave in just 20-30 seconds. My one issue with them is they are BIG. Eat one of these and you won't have room for dessert. Would be fabulous for a brunch dish, or a vegetarian main dish."
2002332168,438883,2018-11-14,5,"This soup is fantastic! I was feeling a little disappointed that it didn’t taste “exactly” like Panera’s, but then I read a previous review to add some lemon juice, which made it perfect!! Exactly like Panera."
2002331613,163724,2018-11-14,1,"331' of elevation here, was afraid whites would be runny so I stuck with the full five minutes (which according to this submitter should have made them set a little more solid), using egg timer, ice water and following directions to a tee. Still eggs were so soft after peeling that they flattened out while they were waiting to be put in my ramen. I cut one open and the yolk oozed out beautifully but half the white also slid out like a big snot ball. If I had decreased the time at all only a slight amount the set white would have been so thin it would have just broken open while lying there. I wont be rude and complain about the recipe, I just dont understand how this can work so perfectly for so many people and be such an epic failure for me. ??"
2002331767,349246,2018-11-14,1,"Ick. Half-star at best, I would never use this recipe again. I followed the recipe exactly, I used oil, and milk. It was crumbly and spongy at the same time, and really dry and down-right nasty. I tried to save it by adding chocolate syrup on top and ice cream but it couldn't be saved.. I was looking forward to a pregnancy dessert and I was so disappointed."
2002095217,439307,2018-11-14,0,Don't try to pressure fry in your standard pressure cooker. Extremely dangerous. Google pressure fryer if you want to dabble in that delicious but expensive style of cooking.
2002331709,3741,2018-11-14,5,This is the tried and true recipe that has been on the back of Ocean Spray cranberries bags for years. One thing I do is substitute half of the water with apple cider. The little bit of cider spices produces an interesting and subtle taste. Sometimes I will also add an additional pinch of cinnamon.
266635,517592,2018-11-14,5,"A great recipe for pinto beans without having to babysit them on the stove. I couldn't find my bean seasoning so I used a combination of the spices that were appropriate. I had a nice ham bone with plenty of ham that I used for this recipe. I generally add rotel to my beans, but instead stayed with the directions and the result was great."
1803216622,100196,2018-11-14,0,This is absolutely the best icing I have ever tasted and the easiest icing I have ever made. This will be the only icing I will ever be making from now on ! I would never be able to tell the difference between this and the actual boiled icing !!!! Thank you so much !
2002331939,95916,2018-11-14,1,Don't call it a Hooters copy cat recipe if you've never even had Hooters wings
2002332332,509668,2018-11-14,5,Loved this! I doubled this and it was great.
2002332148,495271,2018-11-14,5,This dish is so good! We love it! I have to use toothpicks because I stuff them so full! Thanks for a great recipe!
2002332116,468624,2018-11-14,0,Remove this post immediately. You stole every bit of this from my page: https://mixthatdrink.com/rum-caviar/
2002331743,93683,2018-11-14,5,"So, so good. I agree that some small chunks of cheese are a good idea, But don’t sweat it that much or you have is shredded. Also, I used about a tablespoon of garlic, but I love it and my powder was a wee bit old and weak, so YMMV. Try this one!"
2002332060,508968,2018-11-14,0,"There is ABSOLUTELY nothing to change on this recipe! It is WOW WOW WOW. I will say, however I did not have the cream on the second cooking so I used cream of mushroom soup. It was still delicious but not quite as tasty My husband did not notice the difference. Thank you so much for this recipe. I am adding it to Grandmas collection for my Grandchildren. Thanks again! Jonnie Burton Carolina Shores NC"
2000952676,104292,2018-11-14,0,"Gray recipe shows no salt and it is bland without it ! I added salt an poultry seasoning to taste and it tasted like Thanksgiving ! Good recipe and instructions but salt is madatory, at least for my pallete !"
2002180597,87420,2018-11-14,5,"I love this recipe. It's quick, it's easy, it only takes a couple of ingredients and it taste great!"
2002331999,340084,2018-11-14,5,Hi! My grandma and I would make cheese straws together around the holiday times and I was looking for a recipe because I had to bring snacks to my class and I wanted to bring something unique and &quot;Southern&quot;. These turned out so wonderful and made about 50 wafers which is great for my class. They are sitting beside me know and my class is not for another 8 hours or so...it is very hard to resist not eating them all before then. I LOVE the crunch of the rice crispies. Thanks for sharing!
2002331793,99166,2018-11-14,5,"Thank you for this recipe!! My Husband and sons loved these and gobbled these up! I used a vegan butter replacing the margarine cause that’s what I had on hand, also I used about 1/2cup of spelt flour and the rest white flour, I did need to add more flour (approx 1/2cup). I had leftover bacon so I used that instead of ham! Thanks again - everyone says I def have to keep this recipe!"
2002331622,311888,2018-11-14,5,Absolutely delish! Followed exactly and added a can of green chilies and a cup of shredded cheddar. Perfect with chili on a cold night!
2002331900,37352,2018-11-14,5,"This sauce is great. I had to add more of the cumin and garlic powder to mask the mayo (I don't care for mayo much). And now that I've had it, well I will never be able to eat quesadillas without it. I like to store it in smaller portions in the freezer. It thaws in hot water within a minute! I no longer require Taco Bell's services."
2001531666,195699,2018-11-14,4,I made my own super easy and delicious low-carb condensed CoM soup with no flour from here: https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/condensed-cream-of-mushroom-soup-replacement-substitute-134297 I found juice from four lemons to be a bit too much. I also only used fresh mushrooms that I cooked with the onions.
2002332576,123920,2018-11-14,3,"This recipe does not tell one how long to boil the first three ingredients so I boiled for one minute which was not enough time but I did not realize that till it was too late, I added the chocolate and kept waiting for it to thicken for my cake and it never did, frosted my cake anyway and put it in the fridge hoping that would make it firm up, nope ended up with it just sliding off my cake. next time I will try boiling the first three ingredients for 3 minutes and see what happens."
2002331796,499127,2018-11-14,0,"This is a great recipe! I tripled it and added lots of leftovers. If I had any aspirations of uploading a picture, it was squashed by the fact that the pan was empty before I could blink! This will definitely be my go to recipe too from now on. Thanks a lot and bless you for sharing it."
2002331602,126538,2018-11-14,5,I grow my own rhubarb and strawberries and needed to use them. Found this recipe and what a winner! My three sons devoured the crisp. The tart and sweet of the two fresh grown ingredients were fabulous together.
2001286216,320302,2018-11-14,5,"OMG ! This was outrageously delicious ! I prepped everything 1st. Used Italian Plum Tomatoes and fresh parsley &amp; Basil, fresh shallots &amp; Garlic, and a wonderful dry red wine. Since I'm not a calamari or scallops lover I used 8 ounces shrimp, a 10 ounce Lobster tail, a can of clams rinsed well. This is a perfect sauce. The leftovers are going to be fantastic !!! It was still steaming when I took the picture."
2002331541,147154,2018-11-14,4,"I agree with some people here in that these cupcakes lack some flavour so some more cocoa would be good but apart from that I'm pleased with how these turned out. I found that the cocoa didn't mix into the food colouring very well so added a dash of water which helped it all come together, but not into a paste. Other than that I would say the cupcakes are beautifully moist and springy which is what I look for in a cupcake. I'll be using a different recipe for the frosting but I'm sure that will make up for the lack in cocoa"
2002331381,2886,2018-11-13,5,I've tried many different banana bread recipes...this is by far the BEST! I sprinkled walnuts on top the batter and then baked...amazing! There's never any leftovers.
2002323395,462643,2018-11-13,2,Definitely omitting the tuna next go around. Also more curry spice. Kids ate it though.
32253,196058,2018-11-13,5,I’ve been making this since the first time I had it at the baby shower for my first child over 25 years ago. It’s easy and delicious.
2002263230,13269,2018-11-13,4,"This is a keeper. Great tasting and tender meat. I doubled the gravy based on others comments, but you really don't need to. My family loved this meal. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes. I didn't really taste the Pepsi, nor did I think the gravy was too sweet. I did season the pork before putting it into the crock pot."
2002330446,10579,2018-11-13,4,"This is a simple and easy vegan pizza recipe. For those commenting on flavor, that’s where your creativity comes in! Add some herbs and spices to the dough. Get inventive with the sauce. Etc. I do have a few recommendations. 1. Brush the dough with oil before cooking. This will help avoid a “bready” flavor. 2. Make sure you spread the dough out. You should end up with a 12-14” pie! My first attempt with a ~10” pie resulted in a crust that was too thick. 3. You may want to cook the dough a few minutes longer for a classic crispy pizza dough. 4. As others noted, the amount of yeast you need is less than in the original recipe. I actually used one packet of yeast and it worked fine. Experiment! I’m going to try this recipe again and make a few tweaks. Thanks for posting this!"
2001597280,451250,2018-11-13,5,Love this version of recipe with included molasses and wheat germ. Baked up beautifully and richer flavor than All bran cereal recipe.
2002331030,485171,2018-11-13,5,I have just made this receipes and it came out just perfect.Just the best...
305531,537459,2018-11-13,5,"Yum. What's not to like with this one. It was simple, good, and potent. Thanks for sharing, Bonnie."
280271,536318,2018-11-13,5,This chili was packed with a lot of different flavors...I used the whole 9 oz chorizo sausage...and because we enjoy heat...I used 3 red chili peppers...I knew the hubby wouldn't enjoy the chimichurri sauce...so I served it over rice with a side of sour cream to cut down the heat and a sprinkle of cilantro....along with some shredded cheddar cheese...delicious...made for FYC tag game...
2002330544,278119,2018-11-13,4,"This is the best meatloaf I have ever made, Moist, flavorful, everyone loved it. Not 5 star because I am just conservative like that."
2000498330,226379,2018-11-13,5,This is a very yummy bread. Sturdy enough to use for hearty sandwiches and toasts up perfectly for breakfast. Almonds give it that great nutty texture.
2002325761,398608,2018-11-13,5,amazing!
2000940647,136589,2018-11-13,1,"Made this today with no alterations, but the cake itself was moist, but did not taste good at all, way too sweet. I put in for 45 minutes, but ended up taking it out early, due to it being too brown. Worst attempt at a cake I've ever made, I don't think I'll be sharing this with anyone anytime soon."
2002330817,275796,2018-11-13,5,This was excellent! Will be making it again soon!
2002331263,118102,2018-11-13,0,Proper carbonara has NO MILK NO CREAM! if you put that stuff in your sauceit's not carbonara https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/12/pasta-carbonara-sauce-recipe.html
2002330921,22782,2018-11-13,5,OMG...this is the best sauce I've tasted. Always get compliments every time I make it. I didn't add the wine but it is still fantastic. You will never go wrong making this sauce when you entertain. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.
1686076,100417,2018-11-13,5,I always think of my father when I make cabbage. Dad hated all cabbage that wasn't coleslaw. I think he would have liked this one. It was mild and not &quot;cabbage-y smelling&quot;. It was easy to do and the touch of sherry was genius. I do believe that one &quot;new&quot; ingredient made a huge difference. We gobbled this down and I now have a standard cabbage recipe to fall back on. Will make again...and again and again.
1401067,61718,2018-11-13,5,Excellant and quite easy.
2002331397,334986,2018-11-13,5,"This was so delicious! I used roasted cauliflower instead of chicken to make it vegetarian, and it was so yummy!"
2002119722,59793,2018-11-13,0,"I've been making this chicken for over 40 years, it has always been a hit with my family and friends!"
2002331060,277130,2018-11-13,5,"I saw some people were saying it turned out lumpy. I melted the butter, added the onion and garlic and sauteed. Then added the flour a little at a time stirring until it formed a paste around the onion and garlic. Then I removed from heat, and slowly added the milk and broth stirring constantly. Then back to the burner to thicken as stirring. Viola! No clumps! I really like this recipe very yummy!"
2002323395,349261,2018-11-13,5,So delicious. I topped mine with lots of hot sauce. Yummy!
2002331093,79388,2018-11-13,5,"I did have a great result, but wonder how this would be if I used an electric mixer with a bread hook, which I have never used...thanks for this great recipe, I'll be making it again today!"
2002150345,36984,2018-11-13,0,Truly is best beef stew ever! Husband’s comment “from now on you should only make stew from this recipe”
2000175287,52999,2018-11-13,3,They were good but not clear on what type of oatmeal to use. I used to one that is ready in 5mn and my pancakes came out really flat and not fluffy like on the first picture. Also I think that soaking them in Warm water would have made the oats a lot softer
257759,537331,2018-11-13,1,Shouldn't there be some dry ingredients listed here?
2002330306,265171,2018-11-13,1,It's a great recipe but it belongs to Chef Wolfgang Puck not by Cucina Casallngo. I've been using it for at least 14 years. I'd be curious to know what other recipes this person plagiarized.
239758,479389,2018-11-13,5,"You had me at parsnips and horseradish sauce. These are ingredients that I love and this recipe did not disappoint. I made half a batch and have to admit to making a big change. Life has been hectic at our house and I haven't been on top of the fridge contents. So my cream and yogurt were both write-offs (a little furry). So I subbed with a dollop of sour cream and a splash of milk. This worked well and was a good reminder that most recipes are forgiving. Served with a beef casserole. Reading other reviews, I see that this was an entry in a Ready Set Cook competition. Not knowing what the core ingredients were, I still think this is an excellent use of what was on offer."
2149565,465254,2018-11-13,5,"Perfect baked potato recipe! Although I wouldn’t call the skins “crispy” they are still very good. Usually my husband and daughters leave skin behind on their plates, but following Alton’s recipe they eat every bit. I used to microwave them thinking they were just as good, but how foolish I was! This is a far superior method."
339569,25897,2018-11-13,4,Really easy and delicious.Made the mistake of thawing out SWORDFISH instead of halibut and it was still delicious
2002330563,457452,2018-11-13,1,"It was a total disaster. :( -- Not sure what happened. Only changes were I accidentally used a whole egg (not just the yolk) and added a little honey. I also used all-purpose flour, as I've done with other challah recipes. Not sure what happened. Ended up turning it into flat bread. :)"
202814,443621,2018-11-13,0,"I have baked biscuits for well over 20 years and never had a disappointment. No matter the flour. It's all in the handling. Personally, I use lard, baking powder and baking soda in my biscuits. Then I roll them over in bacon grease on the baking sheet."
2002283653,294196,2018-11-12,5,I'm hesitant to try this recipe because I have to wonder if everyone is using rump roast? The photo looks like an eye round roast. Also I have done a prime rib roast with this process and it works quite well. But I can't imagine a rump would be anything anything but tough unless braised. 5 starts is because I haven't made it yet so I don't know. I think I will stick to braising for now.
2000928172,416821,2018-11-12,0,Made this recipe and not sure why the batter seemed to be too much for the pan. I followed it exactly. Have made cakes in this pan before without this happening. Could the amounts be incorrect?
2002329347,36331,2018-11-12,5,"Tastes delicious, super smooth, and an easy low calorie way to get that low calorie texture. Tasted so good I put it in my bong, and now my life is a living hell of blenders, but they refigerate well so i only have to make a big pitcher or two every few days."
2002329173,34185,2018-11-12,5,This pie was AMAZING! I paired it with a recipe to make homemade pie crust. I will definitely be making it again. It wasn't to heavy/sugary and still tasted delicious!
2001773389,463759,2018-11-12,4,"My wife loved this recipe! Thank you! I bought too many pine nuts, added closer to 1/2 cup and for me it was too much, but she said she didn't notice. Phew! The rice came out perfect (I used brown rice and it worked fine). It did have to cook a little longer, but just waited until the broth had absorbed. We will add this to our regular family &quot;menu.&quot; Thanks again!"
2002329053,158206,2018-11-12,2,"The dough gets quite crispy and stays flat, at 400&deg;. I recommend dropping the temperature to 350&deg; and adding 10-15 minutes cooking time. Also, add a tablespoon of seltzer. You will not be sorry. Use an egg white to wash the top of the dough, before cooking. I added cheese slices, on top, for my kids. They loved the addition. Otherwise, ok recipe. Thanks"
2958275,366665,2018-11-12,3,"I thought this recipe was just okay. After baking the sauce was watery, the chicken was tasteless and the many of the tortilla chips were wet and mushy. I used a baking dish that was 9 x 11, so perhaps using a 9 x 13 would spread the tortilla chips out more so they would all be crispy. It was an easy meal to put together and I served it over lime-cilantro rice. I don't think I would make it again. I"
2002198799,286575,2018-11-12,1,Suvj a disappointment. Image deceiving as it shows a thicker consistency frosting but I tried it and mine is runny. Wasted my ingredients.
2002329649,457224,2018-11-12,3,"When cooking this on the stove stop, I wasn't sure if this should be on low the whole 10 minutes it's sitting or if the heat should be off. Smells like hotdogs according to my husband....not sure if that's a good or bad thing yet..."
2001932925,90387,2018-11-12,4,"This was great but not enough. Next time I will triple the recipe. I also used the paddle mixer on my stand mixer and mixed for 10 minutes to get the consistency. I also used sweetened condensed milk, 1/4 cup vinegar and garlic for the sweet sauce. Was perfect except for my folding technique"
2002329763,126623,2018-11-12,5,Very good!! Only changes I made was doubled the potatoes and added a can of cream of mushroom soup and squirt of mustard to the sauce. Since I doubled the potatoes I think next time I'll put 50% more meat.. so 1 1/2 pounds. Thanks for the recipe!!! VERY GOOD!!
2002329303,170721,2018-11-12,4,"i made exactly as written but thought it was too buttery (crazy, i know!) but honestly the strongest flavor was the butter. dunno if butter from grass-fed cows is more butter-esque?? anyway, i will definitely make this again just with less butter. and i will probably use balsamic vinegar to punch up that flavor."
2001773389,455567,2018-11-12,5,"My wife and I both loved this! Great combination of spices. We kept it simple and served with Trader Joe's &quot;middle eastern&quot; flatbread and some hummus. My wife cut hers into bite sizes and made a &quot;taco&quot; with it and loved it. We were even able to get this one in on a weeknight! We used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and so they cooked a little quicker (did 25 minutes instead of 30). Thank you!"
1803038452,195086,2018-11-12,5,"We do a lot of canning and jelly making, so we were skeptical about the simplicity of the marmalade. Not only was it easy, but it was absolutely amazing. Perfection."
2002329075,107072,2018-11-12,5,Easy directions and turned out great. I would have liked a little more sauce. What should I add so as to maintain the flavour balance?
2002329508,242179,2018-11-12,2,"Perhaps Alaskan low-bush cranberries are different than commercially available cranberries, but the filling is straight-up inedibly bitter and sour as written. Two stars because it's easily rescued with the addition of some sugar. (I also added some lemon zest; yummy but unnecessary)."
2002328984,154224,2018-11-12,5,"I made this for the 2nd time today and my husband loved it again. I didn’t have the pepperoni so I thawed leftover meatballs and sliced them in layers instead. I also added sliced mushrooms (one of my favorites) and it was just as tasty with my adjustments. I need to take a large dish to a family birthday dinner, so I think I will take one vegetarian and one meat, easy to do with this recipe and something that will make everyone happy. This is going to become one of my Go-to recipes!"
2002329856,363765,2018-11-12,5,"These are amazing! I was super nervous about the ratio of oatmeal and flour to wet ingredients, but they were so great! I was also scared about the recipe not having eggs, which turned out to not be a problem. I did also added: a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cooking wet ingredients, a smidge more shortening, replumped my fried cranberries in the microwave, and replaced the 1/3 cup of flour with flax meal. It worked out great, because, flax meal seems to be a greedier dry ingredient when it comes to soaking up liquids. I love these cookies! So great! New favorite, thank you for sharing this recipe!!"
1271506,59083,2018-11-12,5,"Both hubby and I thought this was really yummy! Living in rural Maine, all that was available cheese-wise was Parmesan, but that was a delicious option, and I had to use dried oregano, since the was no fresh available on the day I made it, but those were minor substitutions. This is Greek comfort food at its best!"
2002175478,110846,2018-11-12,4,"A good foundation, but more seasoning and flavor were needed to make this 5 stars. Second time around, I cut back on 2 cups of liquid, added 2 Tbs cumin, generous black pepper, 2 1/2 tsp chili powder seasoning, 7 cloves of garlic, and added a red bell and Anaheim pepper with the garlic- both seeded. Since it was still thin, I added 1 c. sweet corn, 1/2 cup pepper jack cheese, and used a stick blender for just a few pulses to puree some beans and thicken the soup. Marvelous flavor, but the tweaking was needed to bring this recipe home."
461834,537241,2018-11-12,5,What a wonderful flavorful and moist bread!!! I made 1/2 of the recipe and kept the frosting on the side. I tried it the day I made it for breakfast and then froze slices to have in the future for breakfast or a snack. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!! Made for &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; tag game.
2002329422,63071,2018-11-12,5,Use this recipe often...everyone thinks I'm a GENIUS!!!!!; )
400708,100864,2018-11-12,5,"Fast, easy and oh so good, I even made a HUGE mistake; forgot to put in the brown sugar and had dumped the mix on the apples when I remembered. Had to pull out the apples, add the sugar and then repour on top; whew - even with that big error it turned out delicious and my whole family loved it. Thanks so much for posting this wonderful fall recipe"
972602,38298,2018-11-12,5,"This is my grown son's favorite soup. He has full custody of his two sons (ages 16 &amp; 12) &amp; rarely do I prepare something new that both boys like. They both LOVE this soup! (Picture this old lady doing Snoopy's Happy Dance here!! ??) I subbed collard greens for the kale because the store was out of kale &amp; didn't add cornstarch because it was thick enough without it. Thanks, @Cycle Michael, for posting this awesome recipe."
2002329726,205890,2018-11-12,5,BEST recipe I've tried for peanut butter cookies! Thank you for sharing!
2002330280,18185,2018-11-12,5,"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE! I never leave comments on recipes but truly wanted to say thanks! I wanted to make something for lunch for our employees tomorrow and needed a super easy crust. This one came out awesome! As you can see from my photos, I made little quiches instead of one big and I only did a bottom crust with 1/4 sides. I have bookmarked this page because this is my new go-to recipe! I used King Arthur's wheat flour, LaLaguna Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Redmond Real Salt. I pre-baked the empty crust for 10 mins then baked with ingredients for about 30. Thanks again!!!"
2002329144,136487,2018-11-12,5,Fabulous wonderfully moist muffins that are super easy to make with large yield. Definitely adding this recipe to my personal favorites recipe book I am creating for my children.??

I found this recipe and was really happy to make it but I had to make substitutions for things I cannot buy here. I had to soak and cook my own dried kidney beans, use fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and I used Spanish chorizo instead of Portuguese sausage. The flavor was spit-on though. Mahalo nui loa for providing the recipe so I can make it at home."
2002330170,66507,2018-11-12,3,"I followed every step, but disaster! Against my better instincts, I used only 1 egg as the recipe said. However, the result was that the cake fell apart as there was not enough eggs to hold it together. Tasted great, but it was a crumble and not a cake."
926999,537429,2018-11-12,0,Please label &quot;instapot&quot; in the title somewhere so those of us without one will not waste our time. Thanks.

2002078583,8531,2018-11-12,5,My family loves this recipe. I've made it 3 times and I always brown the floured meat before putting it in the crock pot.
2002311257,5170,2018-11-11,5,Great recipe - everyone cleaned their plates! Only tweak was adding a dash of vanilla after reading other reviews.
648547,44906,2018-11-11,5,"Such a simple and easy recipe! Just throw it all into a crock pot and let it go. Does not taste the same if you try and lessen the time and cook it on high. Cook as directions state above. I do cut the sugar out and add chopped roasted green chiles. Read a reviewer also added chopped jalapeno, too. I've got to try that!"
2002328188,123316,2018-11-11,0,"Great recipe. I completely removed oregano. Added one can kidney beans and one can black beans. Put it all in a cast iron and smoked it on the smoker for about an 1.5-2 hours at 200 degrees, adding in shiner bock beer as needed to keep it from drying out. It turned out amazing. I used oak wood for a mild smoke flavor."

2002328916,286575,2018-11-11,0,This frosting is awesome and very easy. My 11 year old grandson made it today. YUM
2002328127,317246,2018-11-11,5,Decided to make muffins instead. Followed another reviewers suggestion and used 1 cup of fresh cranberries (chopped after measuring). Drizzled with lemon glaze and added a sprinkling of sugared zest to the tops. Very pretty and tasty.
2001242262,448430,2018-11-11,5,"I’ve made this recipe a few times, following it exactly, and really like the flavors. I agree that you don’t really miss the the meat. I originally found this on the WW app. Under the new WW Freestyle program this is only one point. All of the ingredients except the olive oil are 0 points. If you use non-fat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream for topping, it is also 0 points. I also top with 1/8 cup of reduced fat cheddar cheese for one extra point. I couldn’t find it on WW app again so searched the web for it. I’m so happy that Abby Girl posted it here."
2002327949,17903,2018-11-11,5,This was so easy and the result was great. Will definitely make this bread again

2002328219,183081,2018-11-11,5,"This recipe gets 5 stars. I made the burger buns and they were awesome. I then decided to try it for cinnamon rolls. Only made one change and added 1/2 cup sugar, but followed the recipe. I allowed the rolls to rest 20 minutes instead of 10. Again they were awesome especially with frosting."
2002327851,475927,2018-11-11,5,I used to make this recipe years ago from the &quot;Fit for Life&quot; book. It's just as healthy and delicious today as it was then!
2002328730,239768,2018-11-11,5,"Good thing these are so simple to make because these disappeared insanely fast. This recipe results in very delicate, thin, lacy cookies that break and crumble very easily. If you need sturdier cookies, use the recipe that calls for eggs. Some commented that these lacked flavor - just make sure you add enough salt and use good vanilla, and you should have a delicious , crispy, buttery delight.I Finally, keep a close eye on the oven. Mine were all done in 10 minutes per bake."
292032,452661,2018-11-11,4,Very close to my mother’s tried and true recipe. Freezes well. Great fried as sandwiches too.

2002327799,185445,2018-11-11,5,Great recipe...easy to follow and fabulous tasting cookie cakes...I upped the measures of cinnamon and nutmeg cos that's how I roll... will make again !!!!
2002327781,334468,2018-11-11,5,"I love this recipe. I made slight changes. One cup rolled oats and one cup steel cut oats, one cup white flour, one cup whole wheat flour. I like that it is not too sweet. I bake it longer because I like it browned and crispy."
2002328758,490247,2018-11-11,5,"Excellent recipe, 2nd time I made this, as I was craving it since the first time. I did everything per direction's first time, it came out awesome. The 2nd time I experimented to try and make this even more savory and mushroom flavor, than it already is. I used College Inn Mushroom Stock that I found at the store and prompted me to make it again. I also added a dry pack of mushroom sauce packet into the broth mixture. Finally, I added a teaspoon of Gravy Master. Everyone who had it was blown away. Thanks for the recipe."
1653590,18185,2018-11-11,5,"This was very good. I blind baked the crust about ten minutes and next time perhaps longer. But, this crust is great. Thanks"
2002328589,85453,2018-11-11,5,I made the filling just as recipe instructed. No issues. I did not add macaroons and made my own mixed berry sauce. Delicious!
2002328034,103642,2018-11-11,5,"I made a large batch-times 4 with vanilla yogurt, white rice, added apple sauce and vanilla creamer. It held up well and quickly disappeared while being served at an outdoor breakfast for Denver's homeless community. Thank you!"

2002327928,98415,2018-11-11,5,"Excellent, added a few drops of vanilla essence.just as gud as ihop"
2002328241,63071,2018-11-11,4,"Good solid recipe but nothing outstanding. It definitely needs twice the amount of vanilla stated in the recipe &amp; butter instead of oil. Crispy outside, soft inside. I used half the quantity &amp; got 2 waffles."
2002327855,301754,2018-11-11,5,This was perfection!! I will definitely be making it again! Yummy soup!
2001457564,1356,2018-11-11,5,"Great traditional stuffed pepper recipe! I tweaked it and added garlic, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire and mushrooms. Next time I might cut the peppers in half because 1 pepper is a lot. Thanks for sharing!"
2002328709,398631,2018-11-11,5,This was a great recipe. I did follow some of the other reviewers and added salt and 1 tsp of sugar. Next time I will add 3 pinches of salt. I also used Tuscan herb infused olive oil. It gave the bread a great extra flavor! I didn't have any flax seed so I omitted it and it did not affect the bread. Next time I will try it with the flax seed. Very happy with this recipe will use it again and again
431961,14911,2018-11-11,5,"It's official. This is the easiest way to make country sausage gravy! Not only the easiest but it's the best tasting too. I followed this recipe exactly except for adding some Slap Ya Mama Cajun seasoning to the milk. My husband and I don't eat this way very often, but it's nice to know that when you need some southern comfort food, it's this easy to make it!"
2340001,527388,2018-11-11,5,This is the exact recipe my mom made every year for Thanksgiving using the turkey drippings. It's so good my family always joked about wanting a little turkey with our gravy. Super rich and full of flavor!
2002098115,39404,2018-11-10,3,"I followed the directions to a T- but it turned out a bit dense. The taste was fine, it just wasn't what I expected. I hate to give a bad review because it could entirely be error somewhere on my part. :( I was very careful about mixing, but its very hard to get all three of those ingredients together without some effort. Completely open to suggestions for a remake. Lisa"
2002326573,139499,2018-11-10,5,"I changed it: instead of oil I used one stick melted butter. The batter came out like cookie dough so I added about 1/4 cup skim milk. Finally, I made a thin glaze to drizzle over the top of the baked muffins using more orange juice and powdered sugar mixed together. It helped because these muffins were not sweet enough. Next time I'd use more cranberries and maybe orange flavoring. Or, I'd make a cream cheese frosting. Yum! I was expecting a tarter, sweeter muffin but there are tweaks you can easily make to get that! P.S. these are dessert not breakfast so that is why I wanted them sweeter."
2002327661,141983,2018-11-10,5,I have been using online recipes for 20 years and never left a review. This is a gem of a recipe for alfredo sauce. Thank you for posting. Keep them coming.
2177426,40619,2018-11-10,5,Very good! Used for Venison. Be sure to tie quite tight as the heart shrinks a bit. I don't care for sage so switched it out for Savory.
266635,528613,2018-11-10,5,These muffins are wonderful and deliciously moist and flavorful. Made just as directed and they turned out perfectly. What a nice treat for breakfast along with a cup of coffee. Will definitely make these muffins again.
1802612122,245233,2018-11-10,4,"Good recipe, very easy and good results. I think we have made, eaten every manor of this salad. Advice to you, use Thai fish sauce far less salty than other countries. Don't use the fish sauce sold in small bottles in supermarkets. I use Squid brand. Remember sugar cancels salty. Use the left over brine and add sliced peppers, Daikon radish, red onion slices allow to marinade overnight."
2002327139,384905,2018-11-10,5,"An awesome recipe!! I tweaked it by adding two stalks of diced celery and instead of water or beef broth, I use apple juice..any kind will work!! I have even used Snapple Apple in a pinch."
400708,82486,2018-11-10,5,"Moist and full of flavor, very nice bread"
2002327060,208132,2018-11-10,5,Best. Chili.Ever.
2002326656,496992,2018-11-10,5,I added a chocolate icing for brownies. Doubled the recipe and came out perfect. Everyone at work wanted this recipe.
2002325396,26846,2018-11-10,5,"Made this tonight &amp; it was delicious! My husband was not interested in this meal &amp; ended up eating 3 servings. The crust was so good. I made two pies using glass round pie dishes &amp; now have plenty of leftovers. Followed recipe to a T, made a top &amp; bottom crust &amp; really enjoyed it!"
2002327427,153915,2018-11-10,0,Yes! Just got back from Nepal and wanted to re-experience the flavors I loved there. This hit the spot. May thanks.
2002326632,486200,2018-11-10,5,"Excellent beans! I left out the oregano, as I always fear to potency of it. But so many flavours happening anyway. I also subbed pinto beans for borlotti beans, as the previous are hard to find in everyday Aussie stores. Definitely going to be a regular in our family"
2002327496,257321,2018-11-10,5,"This recipe is delicious as written. I find it works best to stir it a few times while in the oven. The baking time varies but about 13 minutes works best usually. I also find that the general principle of baking with honey works with all kinds of spices. One I really like is to replace the cinnamon with ground/dried hot peppers. There are endless variations with different nut, seed and spice combos."
2002327220,184426,2018-11-10,0,"Just wanted to let you know I followed your recipe. I t turned out great. My husband was insistant I contact you so you knew that he enjoyed the meat loaf so much. He's a picky ester, so this is huge! Keep the crock pot recipes coming. Thanks."
2002210889,52937,2018-11-10,5,I love that this recipe is so easy! I added a little salt and pepper and nutmeg. I also used cream cheese with chives and onion. I think it would also be as good with only 3 ounces of cream cheese. It didn't need 4 ounces. Definitely a keeper.
2002327547,516064,2018-11-10,5,I made this yesterday morning for breakfast and it was absolutely delicious!!! I used coconut sugar instead and put some raspberries on top and it was wonderful! Thank you for this recipe!!
2002326554,293102,2018-11-10,5,"This recipe is the best I've come by. I made a few minor tweaks: 1/4 cup Kate Hill almondmilk cream cheese 1/4 cup earth balance original whipped vegan butter (I usually do soy free, but meh) 2 cups confectioner's sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 1/2 tsp lemon juice It came out a *little* looser than I would have liked, but the taste is again AMAZING. most impressive icing recommendation I've come across in a while. I am currently refrigerating it to see if it will firm up a bit. cheers!"
2002327007,358622,2018-11-10,5,I cut back on the water and it was perfect! No high fructose corn syrup and it’s cheap
266635,528550,2018-11-10,5,"Had fun making these scallion pancakes tonight. They take some time to make and cook, but the results are yummy. Loved the dipping sauce as well."
2001251649,253068,2018-11-10,5,"Just had this for lunch. I must say it is one of the best dishes to come out of my kitchen. Followed recipe exactly. My chicken breasts were very thick so I cooked them on a fairly low heat for quite a while initially. I also used a Chardonnay that had been left over in my fridge for a while and dried tarragon (as per recipe). Ended up with chicken very moist and the sauce was killer good. And contrary to someone else's review, mine looked just like the photo from geniuskitchen. Served with reheated leftover orzo (called Risoni in my part of the world--Singapore). Just delicious. Company worthy for sure. Thank you geniuskitchen and mamas kitchen hope for sharing this wonderful recipe. BTW, you'd never guess it but for those like me that follow Weight Watchers, this is only 6 Smart Points. I added 2 Smart Points for 2 ounces of Orzo/Risoni."
2002327072,411399,2018-11-10,5,These are so tasty! For the icing I added peppermint extract rather then vanilla - was a hit!
2002327538,93155,2018-11-10,1,I made this today and it tastes like vegetable oil and bland cake :(
45545421,375936,2018-11-10,0,"I believe this is more like an apple crisp without dry oats mixed in with the butter, cinnamon, flour mixture. I am Lithuanian and have never had this cake. I am going to try to make soon and rate later."
2002326689,184426,2018-11-10,3,Had to longer than suggested time. Loaf was light pink on inside
2000987929,146664,2018-11-10,5,This recipe is amazing it goes together so fast and The Taste is just delicious I didn't have frozen hash browns but had a bag of frozen tater tots and it breaks down just enough and really gives the soup some texture after I poured up a bowl I added bacon bits and Frank's Hot Sauce!!! will make this again and again and again !!!!
2108015,115432,2018-11-10,5,Very delicious recipe and I added 3/4 cups each of chocolate chips and raisins!!
2002327155,158138,2018-11-10,0,"I made this after having it for the first time in Indianapolis!!! IT WAS SO AMAZING!!! I did marinate my chicken in taco seasoning to bake it, and I used corn tortillas instead of flour... Thank you so much for the recipe...soups are the very best thing during these cold weather months!"
2002326602,83464,2018-11-10,5,"Was delicious, my guests had no idea i used eggplant instead of pasta. Great meal, will definitely make it again."
2002326797,305893,2018-11-10,5,"I have made this recipe the last several years. I prepare the dough in a large food processor, pulsing the flour, sugar, salt, &amp; chopped up butter until the butter/ flour combo is about pea size. I don't pre-chop my cranberries first, but instead add them whole at this point. Pulse the dough until it is crumbly throughout, cutting the cranberries to smaller pieces, but not down to changing the color of the dough to pink. The dough is very sandy/crumbly at this point. Don't add more butter. I like to dump the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap long enough to wrap around the dough. Then I knead the dough to pull it together,using the plastic wrap to keep the dough in one spot.Then I pat the dough into the recommended 1/2&quot; thickness and cut into 1&quot; x 2&quot; rectangles and bake on parchment lined baking sheets. I take them out just as they start to have a golden bottom edge. These turn out perfect every time! They also freeze nicely in ziplock bags."
2002327157,485478,2018-11-10,5,"This is so yummy. I used Forelle pears which are pretty sweet so used the smaller amount of sugar. I also sadly have no rum so I put in a little bit of vanilla. I didn't bother to peel the pears, I didn't feel it was necessary. Was very delicious on top of buttermilk pancakes!"
2002327466,17210,2018-11-10,5,Excellent base recipe. I substituted 2 cups beef broth and 1 bottle of Belgian wheat ale for the water. Also added parsnips for half of the potatoes. Serious comfort food!
2002286833,150990,2018-11-10,2,"I'm afraid I didn't like the receipt to much. I following the instructions to the letter, but my pork chops came out dry, and not much favor."
2002323395,49387,2018-11-10,5,Easy cheap and delicious lunch.
2000380842,22782,2018-11-09,5,"Not that this recipe needs another five star review, but it is hands down the best pasta sauce I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut it in half, and it still made like a week's worth of sauce!"
2002326285,242054,2018-11-09,0,"Lived in Spain for about 5 years and have been making Gazpacho here at home just like this recipe for many years. The perfect dish for hot South Florida days. But - here's a new twist. I think that Campari tomatoes are the best you can buy (or grow) and they have recently been on sale for under $2/lb here. Made up a batch of Gazpacho with the Campari's this week and, IMHO, the best Gazpacho by far!! Do try it"
326523,29351,2018-11-09,5,"The chili paste alone made the dish quite hot, and I omitted the chili's. I also grated the ginger, and used vegetable broth with homegrown lemongrass. Really good! I'll add this to my short-list of great soups."
2002325845,137860,2018-11-09,5,Fast and easy! Used onion powder instead of chopping onions and added at the time of oregano.
2002326111,139372,2018-11-09,4,Very good. The only thing I would add is possibly another banana or more butter. I found it to be a little dry.
2002326143,484958,2018-11-09,5,Very good recipe for keto and low carb. I made some swaps- a) soymilk for coco 2) 1 Egg instead of egg white 3) added a tbsp of super seeds trader joes. Came out quite flavorful
2001738247,13221,2018-11-09,0,"'Press the potatoes with paper towels to remove all water. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl. Sprinkle the potatoes with oil, tossing the potatoes to disburse it.' As I am an editor I can't resist correcting text: Delete 'Press the potatoes with paper towels to remove all water' as it's written twice. Sprinkle the potatoes with oil, tossing the potatoes to disburse it. The writer meant 'disperse not disburse, but 'to ensure full coverage would also work:) Leaving the skin on is much more healthy - as for normal potatoes. One further point - Kosher salt is not so common in Australia - normal cooking salt is fine - Kosher Salt is only needed for recipes such as Confit Duck when drying the meat out is important."
2002325888,306750,2018-11-09,5,"I ran across this recipe from an email my Father (who passed away). I never knew he cooked his own meals, with all the order out slips I found in his kitchen. But, he did, as I did. I love cooking, and this is going to be a welcome surprise for my mouth and tummy. I love chicken! Thanks, Father!"
2002323783,89204,2018-11-09,0,"This dinner was a hit with the whole family! We served it with warm tortillas and tasted amazing. I also like things much spicier than my children so i added some hot sauce to my bowl and it tasted even more amazing. Definitely recommend for an easy, low cost meal!"
2001033971,398917,2018-11-09,2,"This recipe didn't work for me. Not sure what I did wrong. I used the cup measurements, since I didn't have a good way to measure the weight of the ingredients, so maybe that was the problem. It ended up being more like pudding than cake after two brown rice cycles."
1492957,8596,2018-11-09,5,This was awesome and tasted even better the next day. My daugther said that it tastes just like Olive Gardens. I did what another reviewer said to add the Heavy Cream and wait till it starts to boil and then add the Cream Cheese and keep stirring until melted. I even made it for one of my student aide at my school and she just loved it. I even saute sliced chicken breast in garlic and parsley and added to the recipe after it was done.
2002325033,192796,2018-11-09,1,Someone needs to fix the major typo on this recipe. This calls for 2 TABLESPOONS of cayenne pepper. I made as written and have now dumped an entire pot of expensive soup doen the drain. It is absolutely inedible.
2002326265,44901,2018-11-09,4,"I thought this recipe turned out great. I substituted the vegetable oil for melted butter and I also used whole milk instead of buttermilk (Just because I didn't have any on hand, I was also out of Vinegar to make my own). I cut the recipe in half as well. I waited to scoop the batter for 5-8 mins as suggested and during that time I chilled the baking sheet I was using in the freezer to help reduce spreading even more. Be sure to LIGHTLY oil the pan because over oiling causes them to spread as well. Oh yea, I used added 3 tsps of vanilla. Cook time was exactly 10 mins for my oven."
2002326425,291363,2018-11-09,5,The apples &amp; the raisins merry making the most wonderful flavor. The hint of cinnamon and the lemon add depth to a superb pie. My guests simply bragged nonstop about this delicious tasting pie. The house smelled great when baking this pie. This recipe is a definite keeper!
2002326352,210339,2018-11-09,0,I like this recipe i try it my self and was able to enjoy a good delicious meal
266635,536212,2018-11-09,5,This was a great way to make this loaded potato dish. The only change I made was to omit the onions and just use the green onions only. I covered the potatoes with parchment paper vs. foil and they turned out perfectly. Definitely a repeat at our house.
2002325672,145803,2018-11-09,5,Thank you for posting this. It reminds of my mom’s cooking. I am a beginner and your recipe was a breeze to follow. Hope my hubby and the kids will like it too.
266635,534108,2018-11-09,5,What a great recipe for corn casserole. The dish was easy to make and the results were excellent. Served this casserole with grilled steak/mushrooms and your slow cooker cheesy potatoes. My DH loved this meal and the corn casserole.
2002326107,109918,2018-11-09,5,"My FIL has traveled all over Florida and the Caribe sampling his fave desert, Key Lime Pie. When we were last in Key West I picked up a bottle of Kermit's Key Lime juice and it is WAY better than your average bottled reconstituted lime juice found at the grocery. This is the second recipe I've tried and he says I now have the right one. He happily went back for seconds last night. Thanks for helping me make his desert day! I didn't do the meringue because our family is not into that, but we did have a bit of whipped cr&egrave;me on top."
2002326191,351209,2018-11-09,5,"My husband travelled extensively in the Baltic region and Ukraine in the early to mid 90’s. He told me he really liked the “meat soup” that he had while there... never exactly the same, but available almost everywhere. This is the best recipe I have found, and it has been added to our standard rotation of winter soups. Tangy and fulfilling, it is unique in flavor, and a great soup!"
2002325902,472743,2018-11-09,3,Where is the roux?
88099,376761,2018-11-09,5,Excellent. This was some of the best venison chili I have ever made. The flavors go so well together. We had a little fat added to our venison hamburger meat so only used about 12 ounces of pork which is all I had. I only used 15 oz. each of the beans and added all the optional except Coriander. I can't say enough about this great recipe. Thanks BK
11710638,62907,2018-11-09,0,"I used corkscrew pasta , followed the recipe and used very small broccoli and cauliflower florets. It turned out very good. The pasta cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the dressing/mayo combination. This is great to have on hand for a quick grab and go lunch side dish."
1772280,369337,2018-11-09,5,I added lavender icing to mine. They were a big hit. Everyone thought they were so fancy. Next I will try rose.
2002326068,532289,2018-11-09,1,"I looked at the ingredients for the brand maruchan and comparing it to this recipe, this recipe seems to be missing turmeric, chicken flavor, soy sauce, celery seed, and cabbage. The actual ingredients doesn't have pepper or ginger in it."
2002325683,9054,2018-11-09,5,These came out so good. I added one thing that I haven't seen mentioned. I coated them in panko. That added a great crunch. Thanks for the recipe.
2890509,385281,2018-11-09,3,"I replaced guar gum with same amount of flaxseed. My &quot;dough&quot; was more of a batter but I allowed it to rise, and it did, firming up a bit. I gave it anither 3 minute beat as instructed and this time it rose level with the bread pan. Ready to bake! Unfortunately, it caved in the center. The flavor is good. The bread is dense. Not sure why I had a batter vs dough following the recipe all but for the guar gum. I cut the loaf into 8 slices, a total of 207 calories per slice. Maybe I will try again."
2001402443,536469,2018-11-09,4,"I actually made this! This was actually quite easy to assemble. My only critiques is I would maybe make the cakes a more gooey version of rice krispie and nix the Buttercream, not sure. The Buttercream starts to get a little messy. But the kids loved it. The strawberry layer has the strongest taste so I'd take the gelatin back a notch next time. I'm just still impressed I actually made it and they loved it and it was edible and really presentable. Well worth trying and I will do for a birthday again, thank you!"
1585524,2886,2018-11-09,0,Absolutely amazing recipe made just as written. The only thing I did was add pecans into it. Thank you so much this is my second loaf I making right now in the last four days. KUDOS!
2002323783,92095,2018-11-09,5,"Husband told me these need to be a regular meal... he and the kids loved them! (i did too ;)) I didn't have time to let the meatballs simmer for 3 hours, so i baked them on a sheet pan covered in greased foil for 25 min on 350 (i think). They still turned out so tender and flavorful, i simmered them in the pot of sauce for roughly 20 more min. Served over angel hair pasta, so good!"
654460,194400,2018-11-09,5,"Fantastic recipe. Made these last night and they were yummy. After reading all the reviews I made a few minor changes. Used seasoned Panko crumbs, adding garlic powder, basil &amp; oregano to it. Since I wanted to achieve crispy chicken strips, after breading them, I sprayed them with Pam and sprinkled them with paprika for color &amp; more garlic powder &quot;can't get enough garlic&quot;. Baked them at 450, for 20 min. without turning them. Broiled for 3 min. and the crispiness was achieved. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe, this is a keeper. Light and yummy!"
588529,10325,2018-11-08,5,"Very surprised at how tasty such a simple meal could be. Used baby spinach instead of frozen, halved the recipe since it’s just me! Looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow."
2002324957,393077,2018-11-08,5,After reading the reveiws I came up with a great idea to solve the dispute and enjoy the most amazing rich and creamy dish (with a little extra work). Layer of potatoes then layer of saut&eacute;d onions and garlic with salt lots of fresh pepper nutmeg and rosemary. On top pour bechamel (white sauce- melt three tbsp butter add three tbsp flour stir a minute add milk or cream 2 cups remove from fire stir in cheese and add if needed salt. Make three layers ending with white sauce on top sprinkle crushed crackers and butter slivers or black and white sesame seeds. Bon appetit !!!
2002325311,83205,2018-11-08,5,I made this recipe today for lunch. My son who is a picky eater ate 2 big servings :) I did use a scant 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/3 cup Splenda. It was delicious!
2002321265,107594,2018-11-08,5,"This was delicious! My family and friends loved it and it is our Christmas Eve tradition now. Better than any Cuban restaurant pork I have had, and that is saying a lot coming from the Tampa Fl area."
2000545920,240438,2018-11-08,5,I only went one step further since I needed them to stay warm until my husband finally came inside to eat. I took the oil and fry drippings and made a flour gravy and put the cutlets back into the gravy on a very low low heat to stay warm...... WoW...... the best beef cutlets that WE ever had !!! A great coating and oh so tender....... mmmmmm GOOD !!!!
2002325235,382944,2018-11-08,5,"Great recipe! I didn't have enough Paprika so I ended up using 1 tsp of that, and I added 1 tsp chili powder to make up for it. I also didn't put that much ceyenne, just a few dashes and it was good! I could have added more heat from what I put though. Next time because I'll definitely be making this again! Thank you!"
2002248640,536476,2018-11-08,4,"This was fantastic even though I didn't have time to get to the Asian market for fish sauce. However, it definitely WILL NOT fit on a 9&times;13 pan. You'll need two half sheet size pans to make the full recipe."
2002324957,215197,2018-11-08,5,"Hi, Thanks for this amazing versatile recipe. Just made it and it was decadent and tasted heavenly . I substituted a few of the ingredients for a unique flavor. I used aged goats cheese and pecorino cheese instead of jack and cheddar and used half semolina flour. I threw in some sour cream, fresh rosemary, thyme and lots of ground pepper. On top I sprinkled black sesame. Wow!!"
2002324758,12591,2018-11-08,5,"This is the best angel food cake I've made. Very light &amp; fluffy, absolutely a keeper recipe. I did use superfine sugar &amp; not granulated. I also sift the flour &amp; sugar 4 times and then gently fold it into the stiff egg white mixture. Make this one!!!!!!!!!"
2002324916,2886,2018-11-08,5,"This is the BEST banana bread I have ever made. It says to use four bananas for a more moist bread. I only had three, so I added approximately 3 tablespoons of sour cream. A maz ing!!!"
2002325261,422866,2018-11-08,5,Love this recipe. I also add the same seasoning to the flour. Other than that it's a delicious easy recipe.
2002325463,51104,2018-11-08,5,Very easy to make. I use butter flavored crisco sticks for butter. Quite delicious. This will be my go to peanut butter cookie recipe!
2002325396,19424,2018-11-08,4,"These were very good. I followed recipe mostly to a T, just a bit less sugar &amp; more chocolate chips (some dark ch some milk ch). I see where the consistency may throw others off but it wasn’t a big deal for my family. My toddler &amp; husband especially enjoyed them."
2002325441,25789,2018-11-08,5,"Never serve it without a basic cheese sauce ( made with Velveeta) to pour over the cabbage and a good hearty rye bread. Great on one of those bone-chilling , damp late fall nights."
2002325013,22206,2018-11-08,5,My husband and his brothers loved this recipe. I've been trying different ones for them to take with in woods for deer hunting season...this one wins!! Used a 8x8 pan instead so they were thick and they are SO soft! Thank you for posting!
2002324871,230385,2018-11-08,5,"This is a great base recipe as it allowed you to go in many directions depending on &quot;your &quot; taste. The recipe as is taste OK, the cheese adds the most flavor. So I seasoned my meat (used fresh ground turkey) with lemon herb seasoning, garlic powder and a little worcestershire sauce along with a little Celtic sea salt and I added a can of tomato paste to the meat. It was delicious!!"
2002325559,509731,2018-11-08,5,Getting the right consistency for cutout cookies is hard in the mountains. AKgirlinCO is spot on.
2002325493,381943,2018-11-08,5,"This meal was delicious. My boyfriend does not eat meat. I found this recipe here and I cooked it yesterday. He loved it, he said he would get some soft taco shells and make tacos with it. My coworkers (next day lunch) loved it also. Two of them had me print the recipe for them. Thank you for sharing this tasty dish."
2002141541,81259,2018-11-08,5,"I am one of those people that search the internet for the best recipe of traditional foods. I read reviews, etc. I saw this and gave it a try - and I actually do think these ARE the best peanut butter cookies in the world! Thus, why I am here. I think it may be because of the 1 tbs molasses, which I love. I even had to use oil (peanut oil) to replace the butter since I can't have dairy while breastfeeding my son. So I can't even imagine how much better they would be with butter! Mine turned out very crumbly but soft, and it may be because of the peanut oil, I'm not sure, and baked at 12 minutes. It does not matter though - I cannot stop eating them. They are divine."
661187,48974,2018-11-08,5,"Loved this soup. Easy and quick to make, delicious flavor and will definitely be made again. I used Hen-of-the Woods wild mushrooms that I just found this Fall. Added a little extra butter before serving. Perfect."
2002324709,393411,2018-11-08,5,"I am addicted to this bread! I have served to my gluten eating friends and family and they loved it too! I did make a couple changes- I substituted Almond flour for the rice flour, cut sugar to 3/4C and added half bag of chocolate chips. Comes out perfect every time! My favorite gluten free bread !"
824895,110139,2018-11-07,5,I always keep batches of this in my freezer. I substitute brown rice for white (cooked in my instant pot). One pot dinner!
2002324428,66409,2018-11-07,5,"This is an excellent base recipe for all kinds of scones. The recipe makes 16 1 1/2&quot;x2&quot; or 8 3&quot;x4&quot; scones. I prefer larger scones, but have found that I need to add about 8 minutes to the cooking time for them to bake through. There are a few basic tips that will make them come out perfectly every time. First - Chill everything. Butter, flour mixture, formed dough and baking sheet. This dough is butter heavy and if things aren't properly chilled the butter will melt, rather than evaporate, in the hot oven making the scones slump. Second - Grate the butter on the large hole side of a box grater and toss with the flour mixture. It's easier than cutting in and the scones will come out light and airy. My favorite addition to this recipe is to add a quarter cup of currants, soaked in orange juice then drained, to the dough. I top the cooled scones with a glaze made of confectioners sugar, orange zest and orange juice. I've also made them savory by omitting the sugar and stirring chopped sundried tomatoes, shredded mozzarella and dried basil into the dough. Brush with melted garlic butter and top with a sprinkle of parmesan before baking."
2002324636,235731,2018-11-07,4,"I made this soup using V-8 and shredded the cheddar cheese in the homemade biscuit dough. I added a little basil, garlic salt, pepper blend, and freshly graded nutmeg to the soup. Made about 12 smaller dumplings. It turned out great! It was a comforting and delicious easy supper on a cool fall evening."
2002324180,100674,2018-11-07,2,"I should have read the other reviews before making this. Do not follow the recipe as stated unless your end goal is to serve bland spinach paste to a crowd of 20+. Double the spice, add plenty of yogurt, triple the salt and add chicken broth during the chicken stage. I'd personally let it simmer an extra 10 minutes at the end. Then take everything I just said and cut the recipe in half unless you're feeding an entire football team."
2001220317,239829,2018-11-07,0,"I've never found these recipes to be specific enough, or reliable for mom's or grandma's recipes. I'll stick to theirs even if they take more time. It is better on food.com. I abhor the OTC ranch mixes and such, just filled with chemicals. Give me oregano, salt and pepper, or other pure spices. Even better - green herbs."
2002323871,229625,2018-11-07,5,Quick and delicious. Very filling too.
2002324292,398308,2018-11-07,5,I made these. I doubled the recipe using butter flavored shortening in place of some of the butter. They were so good. i also used cinnamon on some of them..I plan on making them again using lemon flavoring the next time. Deliciousness!!!!!!!!
2002324124,498995,2018-11-07,5,"Delicious! I like that it is lower in calories than those with the higher fat content and that the lemon gives it a nice flavor. I like the consistency of this recipe, too. Not too soupy and you can scoop it up with any cracker, chip of veggie. This recipe will go right into my favorites!"
2002324290,108265,2018-11-07,5,Didn’t like it that much when we made it last night. Didn’t taste right and didn’t have the right thickness. We added some more ginger but still wasn’t quite right. So we put it in the fridge overnight and it changed everything. The next day it was just like Benihana!
2002324673,14186,2018-11-07,1,No. My entire family just had the best belly laugh over this pie. Crimenty. I'm by no means the best baker ever but the dog doesnt even want to eat this.
2002323953,81494,2018-11-07,5,"This was a delicious chili! I love the idea of blending the white beans - it made for a great flavour and creamy texture. I didn't have tomatoes with chilies, so I just put tomatoes and some salsa. I also did not add the sugar - it didn't need it in my opinion. Delish!"
2002324228,27692,2018-11-07,5,"I've prepared this recipe twice now. The first followed the recipe perfectly and it was very good. Last night, I prepared it for the second time with a few modifications. I didn't have bok choy, but it didn't suffer as a result. I used less ginger, twice the curry and in the final blend of ingredients, I slowly added about 1/2 cup of 10% cream (coffee cream), and let that reduce for a minute or so. I also served over rice this time, and think I prefer it that way. Amazing! In the future I would make twice as much sauce as it is so good. Naan bread would be a great companion too. Enjoy."
205750,474048,2018-11-07,0,Brilliant salad- I made it with half kumera and half carrot as I didn't have enough kumera -- very nice and looked so inviting! So good. Forgot to give this 5 stars!!
2002323830,480127,2018-11-07,5,"The best key lime recipe ever. I use white chocolate pudding mix and add more of the powder than written, but its delicious!"
2002323916,225867,2018-11-07,5,THANK YOU!!! My mom has been searching for this recipe for AGES! She found it in a women's magazine years ago and misplaced it. Definitely making these this year for a party!
2000336033,84268,2018-11-07,3,"Lumpy. There's a reason it needs to be whisked constantly on the stovetop. Tasted fine, but lumpy."
128473,533649,2018-11-07,5,"Wow, was this ever good Bonnie. I knew I would enjoy it, I just didn't realize how much. Thank you for sharing this warm, delicious treat; it was quick and easy to make. I can't wait to have this again. I can still taste the apples, maple syrup, pecans and cheese... Yummm Made for Autumn Fever."
2000498330,49456,2018-11-07,5,This is a fabulous recipe from Taste of Home that I have been making for years. The bacon gives a big flavor boost. Super fresh tasting.
2002076349,22421,2018-11-07,5,"Thanks for a fantastic recipe! How did no one comment on this being Minnie's famous pie from The Help (minus her secret ingredient haha!)?! It may help to preheat your oven to 350 then drop it to 325 just before baking, also, for those having challenges in getting it to rise/set - the room temp eggs are extremely important-the chemistry behind baking with room temp eggs is directly related to the rising process itself ;) Thanks again for a simple, yet delectable, timeless southern classic!"
2795375,48365,2018-11-07,5,"Very tasty and moist treat! The only tweak I made was to substitute part of the flour (3/4 cup) with whole wheat flour; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I used a 9x5 pan and it was done in 55 minutes. Delish!"
2002163591,313521,2018-11-07,0,"This is a must have dish at Thanksgiving but I added a kick my family loves. Add a can of chopped green chilies to the mix. It doesn't make it hot, just tastier. I guarantee you will love it!"
230102,163690,2018-11-07,5,"Awesome! I always have these ingredients on hand. I used regular oven turkey and it was still plenty spicy. I did like Megan S's idea of Ranch Dressing - spicy ranch would be excellent!! Bridgetender, thanks for a great recipe!!"
2002323866,46877,2018-11-07,5,"absolutely amazing! my dough was a little bit crumbly, so I just added some water to make it more &quot;dough&quot; like. I've asked family members what they think and said that it is delicious. I made thumbprints and added strawberry jam which was outstanding. they said it could maybe be a little bit more sweet? could I add more powdered sugar? other than that, best shortbread recipe out there."
3288,339990,2018-11-07,5,"Very nice recipe, easy to follow directions. I did make two change. I didn't have pumpkin spice so in it's place I put in about 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also cooked it for the last 10 minutes at 350 as mine did not firm up as quick as indicated. It is very tasty toasted with a little butter too :)"
2002324085,66121,2018-11-07,5,"So simple.. So delicious.. Definitely a great recipe to keep. I advise that you do not put much starch on meat and to get rid of oil before mixing meat with the sugary sauce to keep it light do not over boil meat in the sauce, so as to keep it tender yet crunchy . Stick to the recipe as is because it is perfect.. Every time I have this dish on my table it gets a lot of fans. Hhhhhh."
2002323556,159253,2018-11-06,5,So Easy ... and so Delicious my kids Love my chicken Fingers
2002323382,242364,2018-11-06,5,Fantastic l live in the USA but this reminded me of home in Liverpool keep your recipies comming
2002323635,301754,2018-11-06,5,"I had been using a Crock-Pot potato soup seasoning packet, but I forgot to buy it. My husband was disappointed when I told him that I couldn't make the potato soup because I didn't have the packet. But then I looked online for a recipe and found this one. I was really nervous that he wouldn't like it, but HE LOVED IT!! WE LOVE IT!! We've been eating it for 3 days now. At first it was a little too soupy, so I added a couple tbsp of corn starch and it thickened right up. This is way better than the packet.. lol I highly recommend you try it, you will not be disappointed!!!"
2002323134,322805,2018-11-06,5,Made this for my husband’s birthday. One of the absolute best cakes I’ve ever made. I think I have a new family recipe ??
2002323103,273041,2018-11-06,4,"These taste good. But they are NOT 23 calories each. I noted that someone said the calorie count states it doesn't include the pudding or oreo. What is up with that one?!! I get about 115 calories per serving. So disappointed they were advertised for 23 calories. And I don't think they make fat free pudding anymore. Couldn't find it in the store nor online. But it looks like the sugar free pudding is less in calories than the fat free, so that is ok. Someone needs to change the calorie count. That is just nutty!"
2001524408,537039,2018-11-06,4,"This tasted really good. When I shaped it, it looked like a Turkey. Once I covered it with the sauce, not so much. After it was baked, not any better. We used the left over sauce on our plates. The flavors really were excellent. I had to cook it an extra 15 minutes. Next time I make it I will par cook the vegtables."
2002323269,147797,2018-11-06,5,"Perfect! Just what I was craving! I did tweak just a bit for my own taste by increasing the sugar and decreasing the salt, but other than that, was very impressed with the results! I used a pastry cutter to mix the dry ingredients and folded the cinnamon and raisins in last - AFTER I had turned out onto a floured counter). They looked exactly like the Hardee's biscuits I ordered the other day! For the glaze, I used about a cup of powdered sugar, a dash of salt, vanilla, and enough milk to make it the consistency that I like. I also added a drop of almond to the glaze, just because I love what almond does to flavors. I AM SO HAPPY and so are my tastebuds!!!"
2012965,63746,2018-11-06,5,I thought these were wonderful! The only suggestion I make is to let donuts drain for just a minute or two and then dip the HOT donuts into the room temperature glaze. It makes a wonderful coating on the donuts.
2002323041,2886,2018-11-06,5,i just made 4 mini loafs and 3 small loafs with this recipe and it is amazing!! so glad i chose this one. I did add 3 1/2 bananas!
2001900949,21768,2018-11-06,4,Delicious combination of flavors! Was a hit in my house.
2000653870,111777,2018-11-06,5,"I have tried many chicken pot pie recipes in search of one better than the Mari Calendar frozen ones (I love them), and this is it! So good! Thank you for this recipe, it will be a staple in my house!"
1800611565,249565,2018-11-06,5,This is the BEST Scotcheroo Bar recipe!
226867,537319,2018-11-06,3,"I'm so sorry, Bonnie - but I followed the directions exactly and I burnt the heck out of it. I checked half way through and there was no color change, then when the time was up, it was very dark and the pecans were black. I can't believe I didn't smell it burning. I will try this again and check the time more frequently! I think the squirrels will think they're having a feast tomorrow!"
2002323461,262140,2018-11-06,5,This is delicious. I made it mostly as written. The only different is I added a little bit of thyme and a couple of bay leaves. Thank you for sharing!
2002245059,137530,2018-11-06,5,"This is a great recipe. That said, I have found that skinless chicken breast tend to be dry after hours in a slow cooker. My change to the recipe was to take half the spice ingredients, two tablespoons of EVO , and 4 ounces of beer and marinade the cut chicken breasts for 3 hours while the other ingredients were simmering. I saut&eacute;ed the chicken breasts and added them to the mix at the end of the cooking process. The spices work well together, and linger on the palette, enticing you to take another bite!"
2001830622,42780,2018-11-06,4,"My daughter had thirds! Great batter. I think I will try some seasoning next time...garlic powder, onion powder, paprika..."
2000431901,537073,2018-11-06,5,Absolutely delicious! One of my favorite soups. Made another batch to freeze for later.
2002323255,298874,2018-11-06,5,This turned out great!
2000431901,537071,2018-11-06,4,"The flavor of the soup was wonderful, but I found the texture to be rather like glue. I think it's from using Yukon gold potatoes. I would try this again with Russets."
2002323030,77206,2018-11-06,5,"I've cooked this recipe about half a dozen times now. My family loves it. This recipe is incredibly good. I use garlic, as mentioned in the notes, but I don't use the cayenne pepper because my daughter doesn't like spicy foods. Once I tried using heavy cream but the sauce broke, so I recommend using the recommended half-and-half for rich flavor which is more forgiving than heavy cream. As Julia Child says, bon appetit!"
2002323717,329177,2018-11-06,4,"The first time I tried it, it was out of this world delicious. I said I'd never fix fresh side any other way. The second time, it was horrible. Way too salty. I couldn't figure it out. Then I looked at the fresh side package. Who knew they added salt to fresh side. I guess to preserve it? Anyway, lesson learned. Just sorry I can't add the Lawry's anymore."
1803786474,409846,2018-11-06,5,"We loved these! I did add 1/4 cup sugar. Great right out of the oven, the next was still yummy. No salt! Great for those you restrict their intake of sodium ????"
2002323257,425674,2018-11-06,5,"This was my first attempt at pitas and it was like magic watching them poof! I used my starter which was fed the night before. There wasn't a rising time specified, but I made the dough around 7:00pm and it wasn't showing much progress, so I let it rise overnight and it got about 12 hours before I punched it. I formed them and let them rest for the 15 minutes, then put them two at a time on a pizza stone in a 500F oven. They perfectly formed pockets and came out with a good color!"
1802694935,139499,2018-11-06,3,I'm not sure why but there wasn't much flavor.
2002323709,485297,2018-11-06,5,A great recipe I've used since seeing it on Cook's Country! I use a 1/2 c of red wine to deglaze after browning the meat and add a heaping tablespoon of Marmite to the sauce before cooking. We love it over rice with some steamed broccoli. Great hearty comfort food and It freezes well--what more could you want in a recipe??
2002179259,187737,2018-11-06,4,"I have made this exact recipe every year for Thanksgiving for about 10 years! After a few years I did make a few small changes, but the biggest one that has yielded the most compliments is that I use only fresh strawberries now. I add some ice to the jello mix (replacing some of the water) to make up for the strawberries not being frozen. Using fresh berries makes it seem so much more fresh and light. But this recipe is a great combination of sweet and salty!"
2000431901,478286,2018-11-06,5,"So delicious! I wasn't sure about the summery tomatoes in such a fall salad, but it worked. Love the crispy dried apple chips. My husband thought the dressing was a bit too strong from the shallots, but I thought it was great."
2000431901,515079,2018-11-06,4,Great classic tuna sandwich recipe.
2000431901,17079,2018-11-06,2,"Not a fan in our family. We eat pretty traditional when it comes to Chinese food though so maybe too Americanized for us. Also, may have been better with bone in chicken rather than boneless skinless (recipe didn't specify what cuts to use)."
2002323000,36984,2018-11-06,5,"I doubled this recipe, used tri tip roast and less onion. It was a little soupy, but excellent tasting! Definitely keeping this recipe. Thanks!"
2002323032,89204,2018-11-06,5,Love this recip
2002322931,39087,2018-11-06,5,"This recipe is amazing! I made 6x the amount called for in the recipe, and I added fresh parmesan to the sauce while it was cooking. Turned out well, and the family loved it."
157425,241042,2018-11-06,5,Fantastic chicken enchiladas and so easy to make. Used mild green chilies and about 2 3/4 cup of cheese. Topped with a spoonful of sour cream and a side of mild salsa. Good eating! Made and reviewed for the Autumn Harvest Game.
20480,141448,2018-11-06,5,These turned out perfect although I didn't make the caramel drizzle; a bit too sweet for my morning breakfast. Thanks for posting.
2002323422,128956,2018-11-06,5,Outstanding taste. Perfect for WW program as it’s zero points!! Easy to make.
2000431901,398841,2018-11-06,4,These were crazy good! Love the texture with the cream cheese layer.
20480,162686,2018-11-06,5,This is lovely and so easy to prepare; melts in your mouth; I added Capers at the end.
2002323668,607,2018-11-06,0,I grew up in the St Louis area and ate this soup at Famous Barr dozens of times. For years they had the recipe printed on a table tent on every table. Refrigerating overnight is absolutely crucial. Served it one time the same day and the paprika was way too strong. The same batch the next day was sublime. I use Better than Bouillon or Johnny's French onion soup concentrate rather than canned broth. Either makes it much better. I melted the cheese on the bread under the broiler and then add to the soup. Much easier to handle.
205750,344072,2018-11-06,5,Really loved these. No doubt they can be tweaked according to taste and I am looking forward to making more in the future. I found they were still a bit undercooked in the middle after I fried them but I finished them off in the oven and they were great!
2002323552,347440,2018-11-06,0,This is the most disappointing recipe ever Followed her directions to the letter -ended up with a cookie sheet full of melted muck!
2000431901,72680,2018-11-06,4,"Really tasty. The cinnamon was enough on its own, didn't use cinnamon chips."
2002312208,486780,2018-11-05,4,This is very flavorful. 2 cups of rice soaked up most of the broth. Normally I read reviews before I make something but I didn't this time. It also was a bit too salty so next time I'd used lower sodium broth and maybe half the salt. I used a pound of ground turkey instead of 1/2 because what would I do with it if not in the soup ;) My granddaughter is a very picky eater and she loved this!
2000509643,104150,2018-11-05,3,Pale marshmallows from using oven. Not sure of broiler
2002322407,99156,2018-11-05,0,Love this easy and flavorful recipe. It's our favorite way to grill chicken.
74603,3768,2018-11-05,5,I have been making this soup for years. So easy and quick. Like the other reviewers I add avocado. My family loves it!
266635,428510,2018-11-05,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed this creamy cauliflower soup along with the blue cheese. It wasn't overpowering, but added a nice subtle flavor to the soup. Definitely a repeat at our house -- we love cauliflower!"
2002322480,111829,2018-11-05,5,"I've made this about 5 times now and I love it. It is 100% spot on authentic ginger dressing. Nothing else has as many fresh raw ingredients like celery, onions, garlic, and ginger. My first two batches were made in a food processor and clean up is much easier with a blender."
2000102023,239829,2018-11-05,5,Fixed for Sunday dinner. Only thing I did different is seared roast first. My granddaughter and I both enjoyed it!
2002322565,38298,2018-11-05,5,"I love this recipe! I definitely recommend the chicken Bouillon. I usually put double the red pepper flakes because I prefer it spicier. I wing it on the kale and usually put more than what’s recommended. It’s such a delicious, flavorful meal and it isn’t even calorie heavy! I love it."
2002321213,47111,2018-11-05,1,"Heavy enough to sink a battleship. I have made many loaves of bread in my bread maker and have never had a disaster. I just made this and it didn't rise. The only change I made was to use bread flour instead of all purpose. Yes, I did add the yeast and checked to make sure that I added all the correct ingedients. I'm puzzled as to what happened."
305531,536363,2018-11-05,5,"Great chicken. I made this as directed and loved every bite. I've made this chicken before.......but never used the extra sauce as a dip. I'll do that from now on. Thanks for sharing this nice winner, Bonnie."
2000255096,78824,2018-11-05,5,"Fantastic and filling! I added a little cayenne and skipped the yogurt to keep this vegan. What interesting flavors. Using high quality spices from a place like Penzey's should address some people's comments about flavor, if you don't have any, then just increase the quantity."
1013938,4627,2018-11-05,5,This soup is fantastic!!
2002322859,39087,2018-11-05,5,"Excellent recipe! First time I made it exactly and it turned out perfect. Second time, I doubled it and did half heavy cream half milk and added some veggies. Still turned out amazing!"
305531,359154,2018-11-05,5,"Yummy. I'm with breezermom...........the bacon grease is mandatory to add the great flavor. I had a little trouble keeping the coating on the squash........maybe I didn't have the heat high enough.....but they were still great. Thanks for sharing, Lynn."
2002322024,224960,2018-11-05,5,Made this tonight. Delish!! Not difficult. Made roasted cauliflower with it and it was more than enough! Sauce was just perfect with mushrooms. We loved it! Will make it again and again!
2002321995,78028,2018-11-05,4,This recipe is good but Bill Knapp’s actually bought their potatoes from Gordon’s food market. You used to be able to buy them there for the longest time. 90% of food was not made in house it was just heated up. My friends all worked there.
2716857,306759,2018-11-05,1,"Far too sweet. The sugar didn't congeal due to the vast amount of it in this recipe, so there were lumps of pure sugar on the bottom. Will not make this again."
2002322515,266461,2018-11-05,5,I have looked long and hard for the right recipe like I made when I was in 4-H. This is it. It is so good. My husband ate two helpings and he does not like rice.
1025769,57130,2018-11-05,4,"The gravy was good! I used red wine and bone stock instead of water. Plenty of flavor and a nice, smooth thickness. The meat, although moist and flavorful, did not impress me; the chuck roast was fatty and tough. I might try this again with a different cut of meat."
1802767046,105080,2018-11-05,5,I didn’t have frozen broccoli so I used a mixed veggie blend. Just a little bit more than wonderful.
2002322739,188327,2018-11-05,5,This is the only recipe I have found that boils the potatoes first. It is the KEY to a crunchy outside and fluffy (not soggy) inside for the fries. This recipe gets an A+ for breaking the key to homemade fries!
2002322477,56694,2018-11-05,3,I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The ketchup was too sweet for me.
2002321970,459647,2018-11-05,5,Tastes amazing everytime yum yum my favorate
1804516,322784,2018-11-05,2,Since I live in the US and we use the Imperial Standard of measurements Not Metric What is 260 grams of Sweet Potatoes?
2002322185,40647,2018-11-05,0,"My mom used to make something like this. It was what I thought was a gravy. She would mix it with the endive. Then she would boil potatoes, cut them into chunks, then put the chunks into a serving dish. We would take as many chunks as we wanted, flatten them on our plates, then the endive gravy was passed around to pour over our potatoes. I can't remember, but I think the endive was cooked also."
2002254752,215909,2018-11-05,5,"Not only is it delicious, but also easy to do. I love it!!"
2002322856,89673,2018-11-05,0,"My mother made these every year at Christmas time, and now my sisters and I make them. It's not Christmas without them!"
2002322415,101878,2018-11-05,5,"I have never made lamb before, so after speaking with a couple more experienced chefs, I decided to tweak this recipe a bit. I let the lamb soak in the Cherry Merlot sauce for 24 hours. Then, I baked the lamb at 350 for 30 minutes. I flipped halfway through. This made it much easier and it turned out AMAZING. I was so impressed with this recipe. I will 100% be making it again!!!!"
2002322289,349064,2018-11-05,5,"Best soup I've ever made. I didn't have enough milk, so I used 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of heavy cream. This is the perfect soup."
2002322147,101954,2018-11-05,5,I have never made Pecan pie and decided to try this recipe. Oh my lord! The top was basically candied and the inside was so gooey and rich! Definitely keeping this!!!
2002321927,115110,2018-11-05,0,"I wont rate the recipe because I made modifications when I tried it. But here are some tips and thoughts based on my experience: 1. The glass pie plate worked out fine, but I realized while it was in the oven that an iron skillet might have worked even better. With a seasoned iron skillet, there wouldn't be a worry about the tortilla sticking (whatever your size of tortilla in comparison to skillet size), and you can easily preheat the skillet with some butter; put the tortilla on the hot butter; and pop it in the oven beore filling for a few minutes for a crispier crust. 2. The reviews that indicate this could benefit from more flavor are true. I doubled the lemon pepper and added another herb/spice mix. I don't recommend adding more salt, as the cheese already has plenty. I would recommend choosing your seasoning based on the cheeses (for example, if doing a feta-based mix, I'd go in a more Greek direction...lemon is good as is anything you'd add to spankopita). 3. I am a vegetarian and worried about not adding bacon (given the &quot;needs more flavor&quot; reviews), so I threw in some veggie sausage I had on hand. That was fine but unnecessary. It would have had enough on its own. If anything, it muddled the flavor direction. 4. My wife and kids ate it without complaint but when asked for feedback said it was too much spinach (I packed it when measuring). I, on the other hand, thought it was the right amount of spinach but also too much cheese. They didn't agree about the cheese. 5. The tortilla need not determine the flavor direction of the dish. I had buttered the bottom of the pan, and my family thought I had made the crust with potatoes (the egg mixture rose quite a bit and my tortilla was small, so there were no visible crust edges). The flavor of everything else overpowered the tortilla."
2002322004,67256,2018-11-05,5,"Well, I already snuck two bites of this scrumptious cake! Purely in the name of research, of course. I followed the directions and it turned out perfectly! Hubbie will love this one. It's a keeper!"
2001560678,194400,2018-11-05,0,I didn’t have Italian style breadcrumbs so I used plain and added my own herbs and spices. I also added 1/4 cup of crushed French fried onion. Tasted great!
218105,268347,2018-11-04,0,I have made this Bisquick pumpkin pie recipe for over 30 years now. It is a staple for Thanksgiving dinner every year and it is absolutely delicious.
2001708976,92359,2018-11-04,5,"Delicious! Turned out perfect, moist with a nice crispy edge. I’ll make this again. Thank you!"
10997,82023,2018-11-04,5,"Excellent recipe that we have used time and again with perfect results. We're a small family of small eaters so although the recipe calls for 3 ribs or more, we always make a two-rib or two-bone roast. They are almost six inches thick, I can't imagine how one could cook that as a steak, and I've cooked a lot of steaks, chops, etc. A few years ago our gas oven was on the fritz and I made this recipe on the gas grill outdoors, in the winter and it was just as good. If you follow the directions regarding the heat and use a meat thermometer, you can't go wrong. Thank you Kittencal, another winner!"
2002121879,165254,2018-11-04,5,Thanks to you I will never be fraud to cook steak ever again. My fillets came out perfect. Thank yoy??????
2002048922,66191,2018-11-04,0,From the head of the snake...Chili’s black beans are canned black beans with the only addition of their salsa!!! They do top the beans with a little pico!!
2002321775,219926,2018-11-04,5,AMAZING! I cut the white sugar by 1/4 cup and omitted all the brown sugar as my husband is diabetic and they turned out SO GOOD!
2002320976,39145,2018-11-04,5,"This was so incredibly good. I didn't have worcester sauce, so I subbed with A-1 sauce. The flavors melded so perfectly. This is definitely my new go to marinade. Thank you for sharing."
2002321889,431710,2018-11-04,5,Just made this to top my taco stuffed peppers. It’s great because I always have Greek yogurt and lemon. Would anyone know how long it lasts in the fridge though?
2002321834,262140,2018-11-04,5,"Super tasty! I made this as directed, using organic golden potatoes. Be sure to grate your own cheese, as the stuff that comes in a bag has anti-caking agents on it and may give you trouble when melting it. I had to work a bit to convince my 4 year old to try it - calling it french fry soup helped, ha! She said it was delicious!"
2002155884,71360,2018-11-04,5,Great recipe. I never thought it was this easy to make breadstick! Follow everything to a T . My family loves it!
2002321868,108248,2018-11-04,5,Excellent recipe!!! One of our family favorites!
2002320938,82226,2018-11-04,5,mm.. can't stop sipping. you're like a drug dealer :p this is really good
2002321799,69173,2018-11-04,5,I hardly EVER write reviews but had to with this one.....I've been trying to make my meatballs come out close to how my Grandma's do....and this is the closest I've ever gotten.....this one is a keeper for me!!! :D
2002320865,127747,2018-11-04,0,"Enjoyed your recipe so much! Very similar to our family recipe, except for a little tweeking of my own: I like to use Beef Shank meat and Beef Bones with BONE MARROW still in them to give the soup a more delicious taste. I wash the meat and bones really good before I use them. I also prefer to peel my carrots and my potatoes. I like to add 1 can of garbanzo beans and fresh green beans too. FIRST, I wash the meat and bones and put these in a large pot filled with cool water together with 5 peeled garlic cloves and salt. This cooks covered at rapid boil for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (depending on the amount of meat). During the cooking time of the meat I check for any foam that rises to the top and remove it. After 1/12 hrs. to 2 hours of rapid boiling, I check the meat for tenderness and remove the garlic. Then I add 1/2 med onion, 3 celery sticks cut-up, and the veggies: 3 peeled and cut-up carrots, 3 corns cut in 1/2, 4 med peeled russet potatoes cut in half, 1/2 can garbanzo beans, and a small bunch of fresh green beans. I cover and bring it to a rapid boil again and cook for 15 minutes. After 15 min. I check if the soup needs more salt, I add more if necessary. Finally I add the cabbage 1/2 a head cut in quarters, 3 cut-up zucchini, and 3 sprigs of cilantro. I cover and bring it to a rapid boil again and cook it for another 10 minutes. It should be done now. When all is done, I serve my soup in a bowl and add some minced chives, minced cilantro, a little bit of minced serrano chile, and some squeezed lime juice. The soup goes good with fresh corn or flour tortillas and a side plate of Mexican rice and slices of Avocado. Thanks so much for your recipe!!!"
242766,515035,2018-11-04,5,"What a wonderful memory from my childhood. When I was young, these ice cream bars were called 50/50 bars. They were definitely among my favorite ice cream treats. These were very quick and easy to make, and so delicious. I couldn't find vanilla frozen yogurt at any of my stores so I had to use vanilla ice cream instead. We really enjoyed this blast from the past. **Made for 2018 Football Pool**"
2002137513,239829,2018-11-04,0,There are no &quot;pan juices&quot; when cooking in a crock.
2002321239,182036,2018-11-04,4,"Great starter recipe!! I tweaked it to give it a southwest flavor. First, I had to use cream of mushroom because that's all I had. I increased the tuna to 15 oz. (three cans), and added the following veggies: chopped onion, red pepper, and green onion, minced jalapeno and celery, all sauteed in bacon grease. I also used bacon grease for the baking pan and the bread crumbs, added some hot sauce to the soup/mayo mixture, and added cayenne flakes to the crumbs as well. This brought it up to about a 4.7; sauce could've been a wee bit thicker so I'll probably use a little less milk next time around."
2416960,99476,2018-11-04,5,Very easy to make! The whole family loved it!! And I have a picky family. The only thing I changed I added more veggies &amp; meat &amp; added water chestnuts. Will definitely be making this again &amp; again.
45878071,197878,2018-11-04,5,"This was a rave hit at dinner a dinner party last night! I used my own fresh dried rosemary and maple bacon crumbles with Saint Andre brie from the freezer I had. I am going back to the depot to get another wheel, cut it into wedges re-wrap and freeze. Cook bacon freeze, cut up french bread and freeze. Holidays are here, I don't want to be caught without ingredients on hand this is so easy! Will be great for last minute holiday guests. This could be served as a meal with a hot bowl of onion soup. I did prep this in advance a couple hours didn't get too soggy, everyone still devoured it. Toasted in mini toaster oven darkness set at 2 max # slices - hit start button 2x. Thank you for this recipe."
266635,262588,2018-11-04,5,I chose this recipe because of the interesting combination of ingredients and it did not disappoint. Prepared this casserole for our lunch today and made per directions; although I did leave out 1/4 tsp of basil. The zucchini and rice were nice and tender and the cottage cheese and mushroom soup gave it a very creamy texture. Definitely a repeat at our house.
2002321812,283311,2018-11-04,4,I thought this was a solid recipe but it was missing something. Based on other Shepherd's pies I've had in the past I added peas to it and that kicked it up a notch. I feel like the insides need to be left more wet and the sauce made thicker because it can dry out a bit with the potatoes on top. But overall a very solid recipe.
2002317386,487003,2018-11-04,2,"Like many others, I must agree the cake was crazy oily. I don't tweak recipes the first time I try them but was really hesitant to use the 1 full cup of oil called for in the instructions. I have read other reviews on different sites where people accidentally left the oil out and it still was moist. I will try again but reduce oil by half. Cake was still tasty, but I dont want to serve guests a cake in a swimming pool of oil."
2002291618,440966,2018-11-04,5,"This was really good! Loved the sauce! I left the carrots and celery out since I was out of both of them and added some freshly chopped oregano, and cumin (as I have always done) to the meat mixture. We enjoyed it and my mom and aunt loved it two days later! It was still moist when I reheated it! Will be using this as my go-to for meatloaf for now on!"
2002321831,262140,2018-11-04,5,Used bacon because I didn't have any ham and it was delicious!! Thanks for the great recipe that the whole family enjoyed!
2002320927,66513,2018-11-04,5,"Great, quick and easy dinner! Had all of the ingredients, followed the recipe exactly...I used White Cooking Wine in place is white wine and the hubs really enjoyed this dish. Will definitely make it again! Tart apples work best for flavor and texture. I used a Sweet Tango apple, but Fuji would also work well."
45878071,278742,2018-11-04,5,"l Love the pinenuts and curry in this. Served at room temp, shred your carrots. I also made a pearl couscous with a single diced plum tomato a hand full of sugar snap peas, fresh cilantro and 4 oz of pesto. So good! Thank you!!"
2002184411,397228,2018-11-04,4,Used this decorating idea for my own deviled eggs recipe. Very cute!
2001691688,181106,2018-11-04,0,"Absolutely perfect recipe. I'm not saying that because mine comes out perfect, because I've been experimenting. I've found you don't need the entire amount of salt (I have high blood pressure so cut it in half) and it comes out perfectly. The only problem I have with the recipe is that it makes too much for two 9x5 pans. So, tonight I cut the dough into thirds and, although they're not done baking yet, a peek in the oven makes me think this is the solution for my bread's &quot;hangover.&quot; I also found a very cool trick on another website -- I went to Walmart and bought a pack of 10 shower caps. They stunk so I washed them, but they fit perfectly over both the bowl and the pan during rising. Anyway, now I know why this site has the word &quot;genius&quot; in it. . .this recipe is GENIUS."
1623019,87047,2018-11-04,5,"Mmm, love this recipe!!"
2002320837,274926,2018-11-04,0,"Easy and delicious go-to recipe for left over rotisserie chicken. I don't even measure anything anymore - this recipe is very adaptable and forgiving. As a tip, I use green onions instead of regular onions. They give great flavor and don't need to be pre-sauteed to not taste raw."
2002321070,65340,2018-11-04,5,"These buns were fabulous. Followed the recipe exactly, except that I halved everything to make a smaller batch. Worked out perfectly!!!"
198154,218874,2018-11-04,4,Tired after working all day and didn't want to run to the store. Only had frozen broccoli and cream of mushroom soup. Still turned out great. Perfect when you are looking for a quick and easy meal.
2002321740,26251,2018-11-04,5,My family loves &quot;my secret rice seasoning&quot;. ?? Turns everyday rice into a tasty side dish. Thanks!
2002321853,434863,2018-11-04,5,Love this recipe. Have made multiple times and changed it up using ground pork and broccoli slaw instead of cabbage. It is definitely addictive!
2002184411,333510,2018-11-04,4,Used this idea for decorating my own homemade spicy pimento cheese for a Halloween work potluck. Very cute!
2002321199,251651,2018-11-04,5,"after 50+ years of boiling.. decided to try something different.. baked?? who would have thought?? made my typical potato, sour cream, cream cheese filling.. added more dill, salt and pepper to sauce.. my quantity about 70.. yummy.. and easy to make.. i plan on sharing ur recipe.. thx.."
2002321359,36203,2018-11-04,0,"THANK YOU SO MUCH! I've searched high and low for the Chocolatier magazine I saved through many moves and somehow have managed to lose, with butter stains all over it. So I was thrilled to find it here. I'm with you, the best chocolate chip cookies ever. Thank you so much for not only sharing, but referencing Chocolatier magazine."
45878071,139664,2018-11-04,5,"Loved this! Had a homemade Hoisin marinade on hand. Made 3 slender loins at dinner last night, 2 loins served 7. Wrapped in maple bacon. Baked at 350-375 in mini toaster 30 -40 min., watching after 20 minutes. Sprinkled with sugar at end. Perfect medium pink 150* let rest. covered. Could have let rest after 30 min. for the perfect medium rare. Thank you for sharing!"
2001163864,395835,2018-11-04,5,This is very good. I recipe can be tweaked but I don't think people should give their versions of their recipes. I had never made scalloped potatoes because my husband doesn't like cheese!! ?? I decided I was going to find a recipe for two and try it. I'm so glad I did!!!?? I see now how this can be adjusted to individual tastes. Thanks for a YUMMY ?? recipe!! I will eat my fill of the leftovers tomorrow night!!!
2001928915,77334,2018-11-04,4,"this was a good soup, only change i made was to add diced celery and diced carrot to bump up the veggie factor. Overall, a good soup."
2002321026,166005,2018-11-04,5,"Delicious and crispy! I used 5 whiting fillets cut in half length wise. I used two egg whites and extra flour/breadcrumb mix since I had 32 oz total of fish. I didn't have cayenne pepper but I used Mrs.Dash Onion &amp; Herb along with sea salt and paprika. I was nervous to cook at such a high temperature but they turn out crisp on the outside, perfectly flaky and not at all dry on the inside. They baked for 13mins."
2000500787,28964,2018-11-04,5,"I thought this was good, and very easy. I did tweak it by adding a capful of vanilla."
2001149355,339453,2018-11-04,5,"I use my toaster oven every year. I inject the bird with garlic herb, like you do a deep fried turkey. Place it in a browning bag and cook. It is always nice and juicy and tender. I’m about to cook my 22 lb turkey plus a turkey breast again this coming weekend for my 30 plus guest."
2001906623,214051,2018-11-04,5,"I have made this scone revipe for years and usually I do not frost or ice them. Today I made mini scones to take to a party and I used both icings. They were a hit! As another reviewer suggested, after the initial frosting, there was more than enough glaze left over so I just mixed the spices in what was left &amp; drizzled it over scones. The two glazes did run together. Not sure how to avoid that. But they were yummy."
2002321656,54257,2018-11-04,5,"I have made many a meatloaf in my life and by far the best.I top the meatloaf after saucing with bacon.Why you ask,because bacon makes everything better."
2002099131,46922,2018-11-04,4,"This is a delicious way to prepare ham. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the ham was quite salty. While I know this is pretty normal for ham, my mom always boiled her bone-in, uncut ham in water for about 30 minutes to an hour depending on the size. Then she would prepare the ham with whatever glaze or recipe she chose for that year. The most moist, flavorful ham ever where you can really taste the ham and not the salt."
2002320549,74629,2018-11-03,4,I use this as a base recipe and make it a little different every time. I often throw some frozen mixed veggies in. I always turn up the heat to 375 and cook it faster. My toddler loves the cheesy rice and lentils.
1783373,455385,2018-11-03,5,"Really Good recipe Lavender Lynn! I love the finish of olive oil and lemon juice at the end. I used a velvety fruity extra virgin olive oil and the oil with the lemon brightened it up so nicely. The bunch of chard I found at the grocers was a mix of red, green, orange, which made for great looking dish. In place of the chile, I used red pepper flakes and also added extra garlic because I'm a garlic lover. I will be making this again for it's tastiness and love how it's healthy too! Thank you Lavender Lynn for sharing. Made it for Autumn Fever Tag."
928171,25885,2018-11-03,5,"Very good! I only had two cups of bananas, and I added in peanut butter chips. I made muffins with them, and baked them for about 30 minutes. 2018- 9 years later this is still delicious! I still add peanut butter chips and pecans. I do end up having to bake it a bit longer than stated, but it's worth it!"
2002319938,69173,2018-11-03,5,"These were really yummy, moist and flavorful. I did cook the meatballs in the sauce as directed but there was a LOT of grease at the top of the pot, so I may experiment and try cooking them in the instant pot next time. The seasoning and texture was great, I may add a little crushed red pepper flakes next time but they're wonderful as is"
2002319791,35805,2018-11-03,5,"I've tried lots of recipes, this has been my new go to for awhile now. I replaced half the bread flour with white whole wheat tonight and it was also great."
2000562538,9347,2018-11-03,5,"oh my goodness , this is so good and easy , I spoon it over bread pudding that i make in the crock pot , I do have one change to the recipe, I use 2 Tablespoons of real Rum at the end and it makes it really rich"
2002319886,22782,2018-11-03,5,Delicious recipe! In a rush I was able to simmer for 45 mins and use some red wine that’s been sitting in the cabinet. To make this healthier I used whole wheat thin spaghetti and no salt added cans except for the tomato paste.
2002320734,438883,2018-11-03,5,This soup is amazing. Added a couple squeezes of lemon like Panera does. It's amazing!!!! And now all gone
2002320536,493858,2018-11-03,5,Great soup. I used 2 percent milk instead on the condensed - but it was still delicious!
482376,523043,2018-11-03,5,"I loved this veggie side dish!! I didn't bother with cooking my corn. I just shaved it off the cob and threw it in a few minutes earlier than directed. The squash, corn, and butter combination was so yummy! Thank you!!"
798070,82945,2018-11-03,5,"Very easy sugar cookies. Followed the recipe but added 1/2 tsp salt and used some brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar. Not too sweet, easy to roll out, hold shape well. Made some Hallowe'en dinosaurs for my friends' kids with this recipe."
273293,15301,2018-11-03,5,"This is my go-to sauce for tamales it's, I do not add the flour as a thickening agent. I usually simmer the sauce for about a half an hour and let it reduce a little, then add the shredded chicken or whatever meat I'm using and let it simmer for another 15 minutes. I make the sauce and meat mixture in a day before actually putting the tamales together and steaming. Here are some of my pics!"
2002319430,232242,2018-11-03,5,Love this Chili the only thing I switched out was the sugar and replaced it with some sweet peppers delicious
2000318328,33387,2018-11-03,2,"Am I missing something? Isn’t this just watered down Kool Aid? I made it and it made me pucker. Isn’t this just cutting the sugar by half using the regular directions on the package? It tastes like Kool-Aid that’s been sitting on the counter for several hours with the ice melted. I understand wanting to cut sugar and calorie intake but this just did not taste good and maybe if you want to cut sugar, Kool-aid isn’t the way to do it."
2001177335,186845,2018-11-03,5,This recipe was absolutely delicious I will definitely make again. Couple little tweaks first of all doing low carb so I only used 8 oz of salsa increase the chicken stock to a cup and a half cut down on the cook time to about 4 minutes when you add shrimp and scallops. Husband loved it!
2002319890,114372,2018-11-03,5,"My goodness, I make these for every event! They are a best seller at farmers markets."
305531,281771,2018-11-03,5,"Delish. This was quick, simple, and good. I especially liked that I could prep it all the day before to save time. Helped get this on the table fast. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper, Kathy."
2002320110,208952,2018-11-03,0,Seared the beef with onion in 2 batches in a cast iron skillet for extra flaaaavor Definitely add the wine adds another level of taste - all my friends loved it!
2002319904,243479,2018-11-03,5,"Had this for the 1st time in NYC with my son at a Speak Easy club. Was a little sketchy at 1st about the egg white but WOW!!! This drink is the best!!! The bartender actually had to remind me that the drink was a &quot;sipper&quot; because they go down a little too easy. So be careful! And warning...dont drink beer BEFORE these! Craved them tonite and was telling a friend about them and after calling around to a few local liquor stores, we found the Pisco &amp; all the other ingredients. Mixed in the blender and are on our 3rd batch! Salute!"
2002302588,274522,2018-11-03,5,"This is a great recipe! I was planning to leave off the topping, however I inadvertently left out the sugar too! Thankfully I had added 3 rather large bananas and the bread was really quite yummy. My husband preferred it not too sweet and the bananas alone did the trick. Since I was ommiting the topping I added some cinnamon to the batter as well as a touch of vanilla. I will make this again!!"
2001205226,195977,2018-11-03,5,"This is an exceptionally tasty cake! Very sweet, yes - just take a smaller serving. I am a chocoholic, and rarely care for sweets that are not chocolate. This cake is an exception - it is utterly delicious! You will not fully realize this unless you try it!"
2002319294,13307,2018-11-02,5,"I’ve been making these cookies every Xmas for over 14 yrs now. Women practically fight over them. They are labor intensive but worth it. I give a dozen as gifts to family, friends and clients. I’m oftern asked by peeps “am I cookie worthy this year”! Move over Santa there’s a new Naughty/Nice kid in town!"
377929,67256,2018-11-02,5,This cake is A~~~Maze~~~Zing!!!! It went together fast and easy. I followed it almost exactly but didn't put it in the freezer. I let it cool enough to cover it with plastic wrap then let it cool completely and it turned out moist and absolutely delicious. I am pretty sure this is going to cost me several extra lbs but I'm not complaining. It's well worth an extra day of skimping when we polish off the last piece! I'm sharing this with my sister and brother in law. Pretty sure I'll be appreciated with this baby!!!! Thanks for sharing!!!!
2002319310,304233,2018-11-02,0,"Best Gluten Free Pancakes I ever made! So simple! So light and fluffy, every other recipe I've tried is not. I have tried many. Thank You so much! Have a blessed day."
2002319529,275852,2018-11-02,5,It was delicious and very fluffy. I personally think it could use more sugar and I usually think things need less sugar. it's all personal preference though and it was still great.
227652,536411,2018-11-02,5,"Hi, this recipe was wonderful. I baked mine for 22 min and that seemed just fine."
2002319670,83950,2018-11-02,5,I have been making this sauce for about 2 years. It is by far the best i have ever found. I double the onions and carrots and agree pancetta is better than the bacon but the bacon is great as well and you should cook the bacon first. take it out and just leave a little of the fat to mix with butter and olive oil and then chop up the bacon and put it back in. Cream is good but i like it both ways. Double the recipe so you have some for the whole week. My teenage kids love it and they don't love a lot...eccezionale!
2002319053,257868,2018-11-02,0,"Made these tonight for my 73/74 year old parents. Both myself and Daddy are generally not turkey fans, but these were delicious!"
2002319376,46780,2018-11-02,5,I’ve made this recipe several times and it never disappoints!
2002319446,440966,2018-11-02,0,This is tasty! Needed a low sodium recipe for recuperating friend. Thanks so much!
2002319687,410819,2018-11-02,5,This is a great recipe that I've made many times. I don't usually have buttermilk on hand so I add 2-1/2 teaspoons of vinegar to a quarter cup of milk. In 10 minutes you have buttermilk! The only substitution I make is to use panko bread crumbs. It's a keeper.
2002318371,16003,2018-11-02,4,"I followed this recipe and found this was good, but not enough for 5 stars. It did need a little something else added to increase the flavor."
2002319718,2886,2018-11-02,0,I made the banana bread recipe for a function at work. Everyone loved it! I did add 3 tablespoons of all natural applesauce and it was very moist. I was asked by several people for the recipe. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
2002319140,479113,2018-11-02,5,Love this recipe. I cut 1/4 of the cacao and put cacao nibs. Also added raw pistachios and 2 tbsp cashew butter. So amazingly delish!!!
2001886292,30965,2018-11-02,5,OH MY GOD! These dumplings are like the ones my mom used to make. So good! I have been searching seems like forever for a dumpling like these. Thank you for bringing me back to my mom's kitchen.
2002319740,324036,2018-11-02,5,"I just whipped this up tonight. Ah-maz-ing!! Easy to make and very tasty. I added some pepperoni and I felt like I was eating a pizza. This will be on my menu quite often! Can't wait to try some more of your recipes! Thank you, thank you!!"
2002319712,68861,2018-11-02,5,I use this recipe any time I ever make dip for my husband. We love this!
2002295280,39087,2018-11-02,0,"I made it without Worcestershire sauce, but the taste is really awesome, enjoy this dish with my kids.thanks for sharing E-World Cooking"
2002319344,299331,2018-11-02,0,"For the record, this is NOT Hasty Pudding. Hasty Pudding is an English dish made with flour that was popular in Great Britain prior to American Colonization. This is an Indian Pudding. When the colonists arrived in New England they brought their traditional dishes with them but would often have to substitute native ingredients for traditional ones. When the colonists would change ingredients they'd change the names of the dishes usually calling them &quot;Indian&quot; something. Hasty Pudding made with corn meal as a substitute for flour is called Indian Pudding."
2002204751,256914,2018-11-02,5,Delicious. No matter what they are called. Had them with Food Network recipe for beef stew. Delicious. ‘Nuff said.
2002319019,38298,2018-11-02,5,"Easy recipe, amazing soup. Better than Olive Garden’s because you can make it heartier by adding extra potatoes and kale! I made it for an Italian themed potluck at work and it was a hit!"
2002319508,475156,2018-11-02,5,Awesome because it has parmesan??????
2001362355,57349,2018-11-02,5,Great flavor! I cut the recipe in half and used ground turkey. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of water as I used brown rice. The brown rice was cooked but mine was on about 10 hours on low. Good food for a rainy fall night!
2002311310,131018,2018-11-02,5,"I made this for the first time last week and followed the recipe exactly. I and my family LOVED it! Delicious! I was a bit worried about using bottled sauce and the meat just tasting like the sauce but after letting it (I used Sweet Baby Ray's) cook with the onions and pork the flavors completely melded and made this a super dish. I served on toasted buns with coleslaw as a topping. I had recently upgraded to a 7-quart programmable crockpot and this was my first time using the new slow-cooker. Based on that, I would suggest reducing the cook time on low to 10-12 hours before shredding and 1 - 2 hours after shredding. I did notice some burnt pieces (which were still tasty) when going longer than that."
2002319758,110855,2018-11-02,5,"I made the simplest version, with only garlic, salt, lemon and olive oil. Absolutely delicious! Will get more creative next time when I have more ingredients on hand."
2001625851,67868,2018-11-01,5,"It's almost done int he oven. I added the garlic like Ilysse did and then I didn't have mushrooms, so I added French green beans. Can't wait to try this. Looks delish!"
50969,482036,2018-11-01,5,"This recipe was made on 10/28/18 as part of mine and my SO's dinner,but most importantly for the &quot; Autumn Fever &quot; event ;) .Since I love using leftovers the recipe was doubled. I did however change the way it was layered, I placed half of the potatoes in the prepared dish,then salted and peppered them and then topped with the onions.Then poured half of the sauce over the top, added the rest of the potatoes, and sprinkled with more S &amp; P. After adding the remaining sauce the top was sprinkled with a small amount of Paprika. About 10 minutes before the spuds were done , I removed the foil so the top could brown up a bit. The baking time was &quot; SPOT ON &quot; We both thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I do think however the next time that I make this, I will dice the onions instead of slicing them. Thanks for posting a wonderful recipe, and &quot; Keep Smiling :) &quot;"
2002318271,217049,2018-11-01,5,"My husband and I found this recipe around 1987-1991 at an IGA grocery store. IGA used to put recipes in a small booklet every so often, a couple times a year perhaps. We've moved many times since then, and I have no idea what happened to those booklets. So we've looked and looked, but we didn't remember what they were called. We are both so tickled to find this recipe! Yeaaaaaa!!!!!"
2002318774,247394,2018-11-01,0,This is an excellent recipe using either milk or sour cream. It needs no adjustments. The cornbread stays moist for several days. Definitely 5 stars!
2002318473,15682,2018-11-01,5,This dessert was an enormous hit at my last dinner party. Young and old loved it! I served with butterscotch swirl ice cream as it was a birthday.
2002318288,227817,2018-11-01,4,We really liked this and it was super easy to prepare. We didn't tweak much except we used mild sausage and only about half the amount of crushed red pepper. The base has a great chili taste.
2166553,32062,2018-11-01,5,"This is hands down the best chili I've ever had and everyone in my family agrees. I had to re write the recipe though, bc as written here it will drive you bonkers trying to follow the instructions with the ingredients; ingredients are all over the place and not in order. Apparently the recipe underwent a makeover as one reviewer mentions using onion soup... This will be my new go to chili recipe as the flavor is off the charts."
2002080145,55971,2018-11-01,4,This recipe is easy to follow but a little bland on flavor. Next time I will add a pinch of cayenne pepper and some garlic powder.
2002318998,39087,2018-11-01,5,I love this recipe!
2002318224,12877,2018-11-01,5,"Great sauce! Closest to restaurant style that I’ve made yet. Very happy with it and I can see how it would be easily added to for more custom flavor. This is light on the cumin as far as other sauces go, but I wanted the nice, bright restaurant style for cheese enchiladas. Best I’ve had in a while."
1579854,495271,2018-11-01,5,"Everyone (5 adults 2 teens) thought it was incredible and I have to forward this link to family tonight. This is best 'find' in several years. Thanks for sharing! I cooked 3 very large chicken breasts halves for 30+ minutes. I used about a pound and a half of spinach and completely overstuffed the breasts. However, the chicken still came out exceptionally moist. I also used less than a tablespoon of the ranch seasoning total and withheld the olives."
2002318231,231877,2018-11-01,0,I substitute green olives with Calamari olives and used some of the juice out of the jar and left out anchovies.
2002318614,36847,2018-11-01,5,"I had this show up on my FB page by another FB Friend. Read the reviews and then followed it somewhat. I only had 1 lb. of beef. I sauteed some red onions, with a little olive oil and some garlic, the kind that comes in a jar and keeps in the fridge, then added the beef. I then added not quite a cup of beef bullion, I used a Knorr's beef cube dissolved in hot water, a can of diced tomatoes that had chili ingredients, a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes that had chipolata and green peppers, and a little sugar. I had no celery or green pepper and we are not fond of beans. Then I only had tomato paste so I added that to thicken the base up. About a 1/2 a can. I added the sugar, a pinch at a time, since the acid from the tomatoes and I do not get along. As you can read this house does not have a number of ingredients, but then my cooking is always a surprise. I was afraid it would be too hot for my husband. I was WRONG! He ate 2 huge bowls. There is a little left for lunch. I now have another easy dish for us as Winter makes its way to Michigan! Thanks for a wonderful, easy recipe!"
2002318895,529383,2018-11-01,5,You are a recent discovery! Thank you for sharing how you design your wonderful creations. Every detail is inspiring!
2002318320,182375,2018-11-01,0,There are no eggs listed in this recipe. My recipe includes 2 eggs.
2001743760,370674,2018-11-01,4,IF cooled appropriately the peppers should suspend NOT float to the top. Cool the mixture 3 minutes before adding pectin. Cool an additional 5 then pour into sterilized jars.
2002304426,13619,2018-11-01,5,"Love this pie shell recipe,the apple pie comes out delicious my family loves it, we’ll keep doing it."
2001297534,28667,2018-11-01,5,Other than using fresh garlic and onion instead of powder or granulated I made this recipe as written. I served it on toast with a salad as a side. It was easy to make and quite tasty. Thanks for sharing.
2000631063,26389,2018-11-01,5,Great and basic roast potatoes recipe. But nothing Basque about this. lol
2000051489,145038,2018-10-31,0,"Hi Darlene. There should have been more space between the 1 and the 2/3. What was meant was one and two thirds (1 2/3) tablespoons. Common mistake:) When you see the /, like in 2/3, and it's 2 or less, the first number, the 1, is supposed to be a whole tablespoon because there are 3 teaspoons in a tablespoon. One wouldn't say 3/3 tablespoons, so when they are talking tablespoons, the first number before the / would be either a 1 or a 2, never higher:) One wouldn't also say 1/3 of a tablespoon as that would be a teaspoon. Hope that helped you. Are you a new cook? It takes time to learn everything, so don't fret:)"
2002317562,178370,2018-10-31,5,It's the best recipe I've ever done.. Today it's my boy last day to school and he had to bring something to share.. Then I've proposed him cupcakes.. He was delighted.. For this recipe I had multiply the ingredients to 3..i've got 35 normal cupcakes... Thnk u very much.
2002317475,331489,2018-10-31,5,Delicious! I followed everything but added more tortellini and some fresh spinach.
280271,370205,2018-10-31,5,Wow! The steaks came out perfect...I used New York Strip steaks...the sauce is full of sweet tangy flavors...thanks for sharing your recipe...made for Autumn Fever tag game...
1803786474,32734,2018-10-31,5,I made with 1 cup white flour &amp; 1 cup Wheat. 1 tsp vanilla &amp; 1/2 cup each of chocolate chips &amp; raisins! Yummy ??
1803530626,375370,2018-10-31,0,What about pan searing the roast before rubbing it? Searing should seal in the juices. Then rub after searing. That should help with the development of a nice bark. cook on low in crock pot until almost done then bake in the oven for the remaining hour of cook time.
2002318082,106627,2018-10-31,0,It turned out fantastic. Very sweet. Almost like sweet potatoes.. mm I will make it again for sure! I cut my chunks small so it turned a bit mushy. But still great!!
2002241800,257473,2018-10-31,5,"Oops... this was supposed to serve 4? I just ate most of it myself... right out of the pot... did I mention I was craving grits for days? These hit the spot, and I couldn't stop eating! Thanks so much for the great recipe! I was worried about the measurements at first, but they were spot on!"
169430,456847,2018-10-31,5,I made this lovely recipe for Sunday dinner and it was very well enjoyed by everyone (even the picky husband). Simple to put together and the pork came out nice and tender. There was no sauce left either. Served with some peas and carrots (from summers garden) and fresh biscuits. Thanks so much for another grand recipe. Made for Autumn Fever game 2018.
2002318127,105365,2018-10-31,0,Can you leave out the onions?
2002317989,289559,2018-10-31,4,"Good basic recipe. Like other reviewers wrote ,it makes plenty for 2 meals."
128473,409698,2018-10-31,5,"Wow, wonderful recipe. It was quick and easy to make with tremendous results. We loved this delicious cake and will enjoy it often. It will be very easy to vary fruits, nuts and coconut or chocolate in this treat. The crumb is perfection. It took 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook, it was well worth the wait. Thanks so much for sharing. Made for What's on the Menu ? Tag game."
2002317490,18740,2018-10-31,5,I do a tasty low carb version. It's filling and tastes great. Bonuses this makes the filling Gluten-free as well!
2002298335,535020,2018-10-31,0,"Made these paleo style. I subbed cassava flour for all purpose flour, arrowroot starch for cornstarch, avocado oil for canola oil, maple syrup for agave and used a blend of blanched almond flour+tapioca flour for panko. It turned out fantastic!! So rich, delicious and meaty. Next time I’m gonna try a combination of baking and air frying instead of frying in oil for an even healthier recipe."
2002317971,136057,2018-10-31,0,"You can use a hand held blender. No need for a blender or the mess of cleaning it up. I blend it in the pot. Let it cool for a few mins before blending. Works great gets very smooth and creamy. I do the blending then add the cream. Stir till smooth. Love this soup, I've been making it for over 30 years. My whole family request this all the time. With a good sandwich it's a complete meal. Rubens or Philly cheese steak sandwich go very well with it. Really any hardy sandwich is good or a Quiche goes well with this. Add a salad if u like them. u will walk away full that's for sure."
2002317970,203337,2018-10-31,5,Very good; I used mexican stewed tomatoes AND a can of Rotel. Cooked in my Copper Chef pan on the induction burner at work for a potluck! Nice reviews from the participants.
141654,258279,2018-10-31,4,I added chicken broth (32 oz box) thinking that one can of condensed milk wasn't enough liquid. Well - that was too much liquid but the flavor was great. I will likely try it again with less broth to see how that works out. It's a keeper and good for a cool fall night.
2002317782,54269,2018-10-31,5,Only tweak I made was to eliminate the sugar. Boxed cakes usually have plenty. It was perfect.
2000498330,417849,2018-10-31,5,"This is a delicious meatloaf. Lovely herby flavor, light texture and the apples gave it a flavor pop."
2002317460,386997,2018-10-31,5,"I love this delicious easy recipe I prob would add some extra tomato sauce/stewed tomatoes/fresh tomatoes next time I see why Alex loved it so much Thanks for the recipe. I also see how you can add change this recipe a multitude of ways such a great recipe something quick easy and ability to change it up to your liking or taste of the day, Thanjs again"
2002317825,196432,2018-10-31,0,This recipe has been in my family for at least 50 years. The only difference is the use of lard instead of margarine and you add the lard to the boiled raisins and water and let it melt before adding the dry ingredients. These are the most fantastic cookies!
2002317405,2886,2018-10-31,0,"I added bluebeeries and the walnuts, was the most moist bread ever."
2002317959,384704,2018-10-31,5,"Thank you! I had been looking for this for years from Midwest Living, and it is so good. And, so easy! Love it...thanks to you, I've made it several times and I honestly am still as addicted. Throw some green beans on the side and it is so satisfying."
2002312797,91266,2018-10-31,4,"I've made this recipe twice now--very delicious and restaurant quality. I've done the suggestions to serve with rice/spaghetti, I liked the spaghetti better with the flavors and did do a splash of pasta water to make it more saucy, but wasn't needed. I think if I do make it again, I'll drain the olive oil from the chicken and add only 1 Tbsp of olive oil for the vegetables. Although, My husband and I both agree this is delicious but not a favorite because with all the oils, vinegar, and vegetables/herbs combines, we are STILL hungry after eating so much."
2002317239,239485,2018-10-31,5,Came out well considering all the changes I had to make. I air fried the eggplants after coating them in oil bc I didn't have space to fry them. I ran out of time and sliced the ginger instead of grinding it up. And I didn't have tomato paste so I used a garden fresh tomato and I had to use paprika bc I totally grabbed the wrong spice and didn't realise until I was putting everything away. Considering how much I unintentionally strayed from the recipe is not bad. I've never had this before bc I hem and haw and always order palak paneer.
2001770534,143070,2018-10-31,5,Turned out surprisingly well. I rolled them into balls and cooked in batches. Also added a little cardamom. Great recipe!
2002265657,15072,2018-10-31,4,"I've made these brownies several times now with just a couple of tweaks, but it is still my go-to recipe:)"
2002317504,14499,2018-10-31,5,"Gone in 10 minutes at our potluck lunch. All of the other deserts sat there. This is THE BEST rum cake, and so simple to make."
2001655669,533590,2018-10-31,5,"thanks for posting this but this should be on youtube or something... this is stunning, you are a real artist. I would never make this myself but honestly this was a good read and something to go along with this pack of oreos... so stunning I would have to pay you for something like this . Thanks for sharing"
1072593,188017,2018-10-31,0,Some Halloween words of wisdom: Be leary of anyone who doesn’t have a bowl of candy corn on their coffee table this time of year. Just leave and walk out the house. Cheers and Happy Halloweenie!!
2002317848,287376,2018-10-31,5,I have made this recipe before. I use chunky peanut butter instead of creamy peanut butter. It really turned out delicious.
2002279930,191012,2018-10-31,0,What is ground potatoes ? This sounds like something to do with the left overs
2002292893,217463,2018-10-31,5,I do them in my air fryer. Works great and no grease to fool with or get burned with.
2001338520,336469,2018-10-31,5,"This recipe has been in rotation for Meatless Monday since 2016. After veggie prep, it is a dead easy, uber tasty casserole. We feed 12 vegetarians well with only an addition of a drained and rinsed can of black beans. See a couple of tweaks we made, but this is a terrific, earthy dish as written."
2002317986,165254,2018-10-31,0,It's cooking on &quot;broil&quot; now but I'm using a toaster oven at 450&deg;F. That's as high as it will go. It's not clear how the oven is set during the the second half of the cooking at 500 but I'm assuming that's on a conventional &quot;bake&quot; mode. Will update after eating!!!
2002317531,427912,2018-10-31,1,"I love cooking, this was tasteless. I even added fresh thyme and sage. I cook for my neigborhood.thumbs down!"
552489,53508,2018-10-31,5,"Followed exactly except no grapes used dried cranberries and presoaked before adding. Hubby loved it and wanted it saved , his family coming from England next summer thinks this will be a hit ..thanks"
2002317544,93557,2018-10-31,5,I am adding a recipe for a Mackerel Loaf. This loaf it is so good. My wife bake this dish ever so often.Try this and you will ask for seconds.
227652,535952,2018-10-31,5,"This was wonderful. That's my main review, but the tweaks will explain more!"
2002317189,288826,2018-10-30,5,So I followed this recipe to a T minus the sazon Goya seasoning! I did use sazon Goya tomato and cilantro but I have a feeling that wasn’t the correct seasoning. Which one does the recipe call for as I would love to try it again using the correct seasoning!
2002317051,24617,2018-10-30,0,I used Matt’s suggestions and the muffins are moist and delicious.
1832710,10113,2018-10-30,4,"I canned these in September and opened my first jar a couple months later. The carrots and pickling liquid had great flavour, but my personal preference would be to use less sugar. The oregano added a unique twist. I would also cut the carrots less thinly than I did this time as they are not as crunchy as I would like."
1803461275,536476,2018-10-30,5,"First time in my life where I purchased &quot;chicken tenders&quot;. Normally I will always sub with thigh meat. This dish was perfect as written, and the 20 minutes yielded breast meat that was moist, tender and delicious. The picture shows though, my only tweak. I had halved the recipe, but felt that I still needed the approximate 9 x 13 inch pan. Turns out I was correct. LOVED this dish."
490764,148484,2018-10-30,5,"I tried this tonight. I was nervous about not adding any water (did not see any listed in recipe) so I added 1/4 cup water at the beginning. When they were cooked there was the tiniest bit of water to drain off. Followed directions as per recipe otherwise. Half cup milk, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper is what I used. We loved it. The potatoes turned out perfect."
135870,150344,2018-10-30,5,I tried this recipe after seeing it in Cook's Illustrated Baking book. My husband enjoyed these cookies so much that he asked me to make them again. I left out the raisins because hubby doesn't like them but I'm quite sure with the addition of raisins it is just wonderful.
2002316693,79308,2018-10-30,5,"Pretty good. Title made me laugh cause my dad complains about ground turkey but he can't eat beef anymore. I bought &quot;Italian style&quot; ground turkey or whatever that means but this was still good even without salt. Though I just used a can of regular diced tomatoes and added a little bit of cayenne pepper, some pieces of turkey bacon and some carrots to it."

2001941030,48600,2018-10-30,0,"Haven't tried it yet but needed a hint on how much Kahlua to add, going to do a microwave fudge recipe for Christmas . But will use GK homemade Kahlua with a few of my adjustments. Anyone ever try Kahlua Icing? I'm thinking just a shot or 2 to icing mix, which I never tried before!"
2002317352,176420,2018-10-30,0,This was really good. Though I added a tbsp of sage and one chopped up onion. I added the onion first with the flour because of the juice of the onion. Thank you so much
305531,216192,2018-10-30,5,"Really simple and good. I used cherries and served it warm with ice cream. Thanks for sharing, Lori."
2001294000,455574,2018-10-30,5,"This was fantastic! It smelled good, and tasted even better. I made mine on the stovetop in a heavy cast iron pot, which worked well. When preparing the rice, I used a cup of the stock from the simmering gumbo along with water - wow! The rice was almost like risotto. I served the gumbo over the rice, and put a few baguette slices on the side, to sop up any extra liquid. No leftovers!"
2000333591,230385,2018-10-30,5,This recipe came delicious and was so easy and affordable. Made it with ground Turkey and added green chilis to meat and stewed tomatoes. Added Monterey Jack cheese on top and baked. Had spinach on the side but next time will add in to the casserole.
172396,109690,2018-10-30,4,"Between the onion soup and the cans of soup, it made the pork chops and sauce way too salty even with out adding accent seasoning. will try again with low sodium everything"
2002316479,369106,2018-10-30,5,"Great base recipe! I used a 5 lb chicken and increased the broth to 2 cups (mainly because that’s what we had left in the fridge). I also rubbed the whole chicken with olive oil and homemade adobo seasoning before browning. I cooked it at pressure for a little bit longer because of the size difference, but only 3 minutes longer. It didn’t come out of the pot in one piece, the backbone and legs fell off as I was lifting it out of the pan, so I might follow the original recipe’s cooking time next time. But the meat is tender, juicy, and delicious! I served with roasted sweet potatoes and sweet peas for an easy weeknight dinner. (I can’t believe I prepared an entire chicken on a Monday night). The leftover chicken will be had with black beans and rice later this week."
2001076856,266529,2018-10-30,5,This turned out to be the best frosting/icing ever.
2002293812,151563,2018-10-30,5,This will be the recipe i use from now on. I made it tonight and It is absolutely delicious!
2000391070,60350,2018-10-30,5,"Made exactly as written (having a knowledge of how to make a cheese sauce already) and it was creamy and delicious. It's everything I like in a homemade macaroni and cheese. If you've never made a roux or cheese sauce, you may want to read some of the other helpful reviews here as this recipe makes the assumption that the user already knows the technique."
482376,204648,2018-10-30,5,"Oh my, was this ever tasty! The directions were perfect and the sweet potatoes came out perfectly and had that great maple flavor. I think I'll actually do this recipe next time without the syrup to test as a new, easy method for cooking sweet potatoes! Thank you!"
2002314116,390535,2018-10-30,3,I had to skip chili and jalape&ntilde;o (cannot eat spicy food). Everything else - according to the recipe. It is OK but I won't call it yummy.
2002316493,163320,2018-10-30,4,"My biggest complaint is the lack of information in the instructions/comments. While the filling was hot, 5 minutes off the heat, I added the baking soda. The filling foamed up nicely, but by the time the filling was cooled enough to add a tempered egg the foam was gone. I'm not sure if the filling should still be foamy when putting into the pie shell. The instruction of alternating 1/3 filling/crumble had me scratching my head because 1/3 of the filling (which turns out to be 1/2 cup) didn't even cover the bottom of the pie shell. I ended up doing 1/2 amounts of filling and crumble. The pie did swell up some while baking and the end result was a very fluffy, airy, delicate filling. If the filling is supposed to be gooey on the bottom as another reviewer mentioned, then I must have done something wrong. I did use a whole large egg (which, honestly, is more like a medium egg in the US) so maybe that accounts for the fluffiness. Taste was actually surprisingly pleasant; not too sweet at all."
2001385401,51199,2018-10-30,1,Mine turned out more like a cake gewy texture even though they were cooked through. I used my regular thermometer I use for candy making and even tested again with a stick in one I have to make sure the oil temp was at 350 degrees. I will NOT be making this mess again.
2002316653,30248,2018-10-30,5,A must to have on hand and easy to make.
2000498330,340917,2018-10-30,4,A nice quick side dish. I reduced the mushrooms by half and thought that was plenty. Leftovers reheated well the next day (for lunch). Good solid recipe.
2002317157,57300,2018-10-30,5,Making it for the 2nd time tonight. Love the Aioli! My neighbors love it to and actually use it as a dip for their green beans. Go figure.
7211484,238451,2018-10-30,5,"This is pretty much how I do chuck eye steaks.......simple grilling over high heat or in a very hot cast iron skillet. I also agree that unwrapping the steaks, patting dry with paper towel and resting uncovered in the refrigerator for a few hours or more to dry the surface gives a really superior crust. I first learned to do this with pricy, bone in rib eyes on a rack over a rimmed cookie sheet. the drier the surface the better the sear. flavor packed steaks like these need salt and pepper, a little rub with olive oil....that's it. Add other seasonings if you prefer , just be careful not to let them burn.....it will turn bitter."

2002316533,218770,2018-10-30,2,"It was editable but could be better. Going to try a bit more sugar next time, neither my husband or I could put our finger on just what was missing. At times we thought it was too dry but then decided that wasn't quite right either. I cooked it in a cast iron skillet, preheated it but the pan got too hot and the bottom was a bit to brown for me."
2001663805,331480,2018-10-30,0,Ma
2002313158,45308,2018-10-30,4,"First, the cons: - This took me quite a long time to make, mainly from the deep frying. - I found this to be a little salty (from the soy sauce and oyster sauce) - A bit messy to clean up after (not too bad though). And now the pros: - Tasted and visually looked like restaurant quality - The chicken was the star of the show, and I love how simple it was to make that style of chicken. Notes for future: I always make the mistake of cutting onions too small for Chinese-style cooking. Will make bigger in the future. I may also want to swap out the carrot mix for something like brocolli flourets in the future. Also, I think this dish would be great with a sweet lemon type sauce or honey garlic sauce!"

2002317255,47851,2018-10-30,0,You canNOT bake this loaf in a 375 oven for 1 hour: it will be incinerated. Half hour in a 350 oven is plenty. And do NOT drain the salmon -- the whole thing will be too dry.
2002316428,276140,2018-10-30,5,This was great. I used low sodium soy sauce and a went a little heavier on the brown sugar. Next time I would probably cut the soy sauce. I added ginger and thickened the sauce with water and cornstarch. I also broiled the legs for about 10 minutes in the oven to get the skin crispy on the drumsticks (obviously I did not use skinless chicken). My husband loved it and I thought it was great - it was easy and we'll definitely do this one again!
305531,62571,2018-10-30,5,I've never had Marie Callender's cornbread so don't know how it compares. But this is a really good cornbread. Served it with chili and it was a great side. Thanks for sharing.
2001774971,151029,2018-10-30,5,"Easy and quick! Just made it and am dunking my grilled Swiss cheese sandwich! We used only 2 cups (16 oz) of 2% organic milk ( a little water later on) along with extra sugar. Salt and pepper! I’ve looked at cook books and searched online for recipes’ I love visiting grocery stores when I travel! And with all, of that “foody” interest I’ve never come across a recipe such as this one! Thank u!!! Back to quick and easy and DELICIOUS!!!! Maggie in Iowa City"
2002316770,370891,2018-10-30,5,I’ve made these many times now and they turn out great every time! You kind of have to smoosh the crumbles into a ball but no different than many sugar cookie and biscuit recipes. My son has an egg allergy so he would miss out on all the holiday cookie decorating until now! About to go make some pumpkin shaped ones for Halloween :)
2002317351,242952,2018-10-30,1,Yuck. All that work and it was horrible. Started with three coconuts and regret all the work.
8629,486905,2018-10-30,5,"This is my Go To recipe. I love it. I tried many other burger sauce recipes and I kept saying to myself 'Well, its not as good as Classic Burger Sauce'. So I have stopped trying other recipes. I am showing this recipe as coming from America's Test Kitchen. After making this recipe more than a dozen times, I found myself using half the amount of Mayo with a Light Mayo and substituting the granulated sugar with a no calorie product such as Splenda. Both of those substitutions worked for me. I was not able to discern a difference in taste. I have also added a couple of tablespoons for finely diced onion, which I think makes it a real Thousand Island dressing. My point is make it as written or tweek it a little. It's all good."
2002317064,143011,2018-10-30,4,"In the US, baked at 350 for a full hour. After thirty minutes, draped with tin foil to retain nice golden-brown color. Increased ginger to 1 &amp; 1/4 teaspoons. Using 2 cups all-purpose flour produced a very tender loaf. Next time, I will use one cup a-p flour, 1 cup bread flour. Excellent flavor, will bake again."
2001650813,36041,2018-10-30,5,"My son is interested in lerning how to cook, so we are always looking for recipies to make together or on his own. When he was 8 years old we baked our first cake together,and he fell in love with cooking ever since."
2000007476,289919,2018-10-30,4,Super easy and tasty. Definitely hit the spot and didn't take but a few minutes to throw together.
2002317250,28758,2018-10-30,5,"My family and my co workers LOVED. We are actually having a carry in at work tomorrow, and it was requested that I make this pie!"
2002295280,188327,2018-10-30,5,"One of my favorite dishes, I made it at my home once a week. Thanks for your article because your step by step explanation impress me.thank you so much for share this great dish."
1591752,259813,2018-10-30,5,Great recipe and technique
2002317134,83950,2018-10-30,5,"This is an excellent bolognese sauce. I agree with another comment here where they recommended using pancetta instead of bacon. It definitely adds authenticity to the sauce. Do not omit the nutmeg. It adds a subtle, wonderful flavour. I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork (personal preference). I also cut the milk down to 2/3 cup. An excellent recipe that I will make again, and definitely recommend."
2002315550,411438,2018-10-29,4,I made this and the directions were very clear; the texture of the rice was perfect. Taste was just ok; I felt there was too much red chili pepper. It may have been that I used a freshly opened box of red chili pepper so the potency would have stronger.
2002315547,205890,2018-10-29,5,"Wow-amazing recipe. Here’s a few tweaks I did that turned out great. I used 1/2 cup of Kraft smooth peanut butter and 1/2 cup of Kraft crunchy peanut butter. I know it doesn’t specify the butter in this recipe however I like to use salted butter with a lot of my cookie recipes, I find it gives them more flavour. After I had folded the flour in I added 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts for texture. They turned out so chewy and delicious and a little bit of extra crunch with those peanuts. This recipe makes A LOT of cookies, I found that in my oven cooking them for 6.5 minutes was the perfect time. I will definitely be writing this one down. Yummy!"
2001402443,34382,2018-10-29,5,I was surprised how you can't quite even taste the parmesan or garlic individually but all the flavors together make for a great creamy mashed potato. Will definitely make again.
2001536450,499436,2018-10-29,0,It is a fantastic recipe but the flax seed has to be very fine and (i noted) better if one adds an egg. However you could try more flax seed powder
2002316073,106888,2018-10-29,5,This was absolutely delicious! I will be making this again many times this winter.
2001869388,160333,2018-10-29,5,"Yum. Always love Steak &amp; Ale. Especially their crispy salad. AND the saut&eacute;ed mushrooms, great cind"
2002172815,3470,2018-10-29,5,"I am giving this 5 stars because it really tastes good! I do have some suggestions though. First, if possible, get low sodium soup. We try to watch our sodium and this tasted a bit salty to me. I used the whole box of stuffing which was about 3 cups and I should have compensated with more broth. I made it one day and then reheated it the next and. I thought there should have been more gravy. All in all though, it is definitely a repeater."
1800749264,149363,2018-10-29,1,"Turned out soggy, despite draining my steamed pumpkins, very sweet."
2002316393,214051,2018-10-29,5,I have made 4 batches of these pumpkin scones and they are so much better than Starbucks. They are very moist. The only change I made the second time was to only do the one glaze; I love the spiced glaze.
2002316272,26370,2018-10-29,4,"I would give five stars for the flavor and consistency. However I attempted to make the cake with the 9&quot; pans, only to have them overflow. Thought I did something wrong so I tried a second time with the same result. Did anyone else have this problem???"
2123645,201953,2018-10-29,3,"This was a tasty recipe, I like the change-up from your basic stew. I like my stew to be a little soupier, so I was a little disappointed how thick and dry it came out. I would recommend adding some beef broth for a more moist stew. I also recommend seasoning the beef with salt and pepper before browning."
2002037959,294196,2018-10-29,5,"Perfect. My meat thermometer recently broke, I was worried about overcooking but I used the 15 minute per pound guideline and it came out perfectly rare. I used the suggestion from another reviewer and used broth and red wine instead of water, then used it in the gravy. I could have done without the onions, my roast was 3 pounds so I didn't cook as long and they didn't get soft, I couldn't serve them and ended up throwing them away. I will definitely save this recipe. I cook prime rib roast in almost exactly the same way, but it was nice to get a great result from a cheap piece of meat, rather than the $$ pricey cut I usually buy for holidays."
2001971006,329114,2018-10-29,4,"Lamb is one of our favorites at Fogo! I tried this recipe and, while I am sure it's probably 5-stars, I could only give it 4 based on what I did (my own fault!). I didn't have the white wine so I used a not-so-nice red. It was good, but not as good as theirs, and since I could only rate it on MY experience, MY experience says I messed it up! Thanks for the recipe, we eat there weekly so making this and other favorites at home will save us money! (And I did confirm with them at our last visit, they do use a crisp white wine in the marinade)."
2001591225,484455,2018-10-29,0,"These were absolutely delicious. They expanded, they got a nice browned crust, and they were fluffy and tender inside. Who knew?! Thank you for another way to make biscuits!"
2002316233,61755,2018-10-29,5,To be honest I have made these for a long time and I have never met someone who didn't like them
2001425450,278329,2018-10-29,5,I added a teensy smidge of olive olive to the butter to reduce smoke. My idiot kitchen exhaust fan vents right back into the kitchen! But this is DYNAMITE!
798292,534877,2018-10-29,5,"This was great, I peeled my potatoes, cut them a bit smaller before placing them in the steamer basket, and mashed them at the end, the gravy was great on them too!"
2002315526,31040,2018-10-29,0,"You pour it on and roll out to edges. By the second plettar and enough butter. It works great. Pans are important. Make sure it's not Teflon as those ruin them. I've been doing this recipe for over 25 years. Yes that dates me and I don't care. My nana taught me this recipe that it's ingrained in my head. BTW your missing a key ingredient to making it more flavourful. Sugar. When done cooking remove and put on plate , top it with a little sugar all over. A little lemon juice. Roll up and cut to eat. Our fav way to eat them. The best way."
2002295280,129926,2018-10-29,5,"Great recipe,thanks for sharing. E-World Cooking"
2002315902,90215,2018-10-29,4,"I am just making your cake and I noticed that the recipe mentions butter only in the dough, not in the crumble, but I am guessing you need it in both, right? Could you provide the amount? Thank you!"
2002247012,98859,2018-10-29,5,"We made 9 quarts, and will make more! We only used half a bushel of apples from the orchard down the road. I love the feeling of knowing exactly what is in it......fresh wholesome ingredients and no added sugar."
2002099990,315485,2018-10-29,5,Made it for our church soup lunch. You know it's good when none was left to take home when a dozen soup varieties were brought for 35 attendees. I used sweet green Cubanelle Peppers which I prefer over Bell Peppers. Multiplied recipe times 4 to fill 7 qt cast iron stock pot. The text says potatoes to be added but it wasn't in the ingredient list so none were used. Hearty and delicious!
2002316397,47107,2018-10-29,5,Just took it out of the bread machine. It's absolutely perfect. Ten minutes later and my family ate half the loaf.
2002315637,71849,2018-10-29,5,Good cookie! I tweaked it a little by putting it in a miffin tin and adding jelly after they came out of the oven. Family loves them!
2002315833,274022,2018-10-29,5,This turned out excellent. Very flavorful and easy to make. I cooked it in my cast iron frying pan and it got a nice brown crust on the bottom.
198154,168099,2018-10-29,4,"Made these for dinner tonight using gluten free pizza dough. Everyone in the family felt they needed more cheese or something, but seemed to like them overall."
2002315936,90765,2018-10-29,5,"The recipe turned out perfect! I'm teaching my 14 year old son to cook this year and he took the lead on this bread. We followed the recipe exactly- opting for plain bread without seed. The flavor, texture, and presentation were so great that he posted it on social media and took half a loaf with his lunch at school to share with friends!"
2002316192,114575,2018-10-29,0,Sounds so good! All these recipes I want to hurry and make them.
2002315963,74048,2018-10-29,5,Very yummy. Had to add a little more powdered sugar and refrigerating it is a great idea along with shaking all of it in the paper grocery bag.
2002315709,293275,2018-10-29,5,"The only modification I made was cutting the onion in half and adding 3 stocks of celery and a 1/4 - 1/2 cup of fozen peas. Very flavorful, next time I will cut back on the pepper, it is very prominent in flavour at a whole tsp. and while I love it, my husband isn't so much into the heat (although he still quite enjoyed the stew)."
1783373,251149,2018-10-29,5,"Amazing Flavor! This sauce has some great results. Served it over indoor grilled chicken strips and it matched perfectly. I can see it working really well with steak or pork as well. This would pump up any meal by 100 Points. Thank you so much for sharing this most wonderful recipe, Maito. It's going in my keeper files. Made it for Autumn Fever 2018."
2002315440,268971,2018-10-29,5,"I made these by processing the sugars and the marzipan, then processing the dry ingredients in. (I used White Wings gluten free SR flour with the same amount of baking powder and baking soda). 250 g butter, egg and vanilla processed at the last to a lovely soft dough. This then became a one dish wonder and gluten free :) Placed on the cookie tray in 1&quot; balls and flattened with a fork. Tapped the tray once cooked for 10 minutes then finished off for a further 5 minutes. Made these lovely large crunchy cookies and have definitely put this is the cookery book for regular baking."
2002315805,100396,2018-10-29,5,Absolutely fool-proof recipe! I now make this pumpkin pie every year and it's quickly become a family favorite. I get rave reviews any time I make it as dessert! Doesn't get better (or easier) than this pumpkin pie!
181807,23108,2018-10-29,5,"My teenage son loves this! I skip the stovetop most of the time, but if it’s not combining nicely I’ll microwave it for a few seconds. I also add a cup or so of raisins."
15718,160432,2018-10-29,5,"This was very good and easy to make. I grew up with these,. However we never used sweet gherkins. We prefer it with either dill pickles (regular not garlic) or bread and butter pickles."
2001455329,366948,2018-10-29,5,Perfect!!!! Will be making this more often!! My husband loved it too and he is not a fan of food from the crockpot.
2002316340,11009,2018-10-29,5,I used Cortland apples and left them rather chunky. What a terrific recipe! Will put them out for the construction crew replacing my windows tomorrow. They will love them!
2002315926,348200,2018-10-29,0,This was absolutely horrible.
2002315492,3092,2018-10-29,0,"hehe... so I was having the same problem as others, getting the liquid to stay in the straws. I noticed the carton just kept bulging out, so I fixed it... I put tourniquets on it! ahahaha It worked!"
2002316371,59359,2018-10-29,5,"I am Italian and my Nonna used water like this recipe does, to bring the dough together. It creates more of a chew as opposed to adding another egg and having it more like an eggy noodle texture which in my opinion is too soft and to be honest reminds me of the egg noodles you get at Chinese restaurants. My raviolini turned out amazing! I served with a simple tomato sauce and spinach and parmesan reggiano finished with a drizzle of olive oil and fresh pepper. YUM!"
2002315892,308271,2018-10-29,0,"I have a question. I have a rice cooker with 4 settings, white rice, brown rice, steam and keep warm. What setting would I use for the polenta?"
2002316095,40673,2018-10-29,5,I have made this recipe for years and my kids absolutely love it. It's also a crowd please at office potlucks. Over the years I have only made one modification to it and that is to add the whole can of green chills into the topping instead of the recommended 2 tbls.
2002315582,30565,2018-10-29,4,"The taste is spot on. The texture is off. Overall, I love them enough to never buy them again..."
2002315446,355689,2018-10-29,5,Love this recipe! Did half whole wheat flour and half all purpose pluse a cup of raisins and they were moist and delicious. Love!
2123645,71253,2018-10-29,5,Delicious! I left out the onion and stirred in some scallions before serving instead. Served it with some crusty sourdough bread and it was a delicious meal.
2002315398,607,2018-10-29,0,The unpeeled onions refer to the total weight prior to peeling. 2 1/2 lbs after peeling will be close to 2 lbs.
323186,535570,2018-10-29,5,"I wish there were more stars!!!! To die for, is all I can say. We could have eaten the whole casserole (2 of us), the leftovers are not going to be leftovers for long!!! Thank you for sharing a super yum casserole, oh, I did in fact use thinly sliced salami because I had just bought it and it was a good chance to use it. Other than that, yum yum yum!"
2002316237,5170,2018-10-29,5,This how my mom makes it
2002314780,357020,2018-10-28,5,This classic Mueller recipe is the best! I do use Classico Tomato Basil sauce instead of Prego and sub 1/2 ground pork for 1/2 of the ground beef. It’s my husband’s favorite!
2002314968,249061,2018-10-28,4,I made these but now I am sorry I did. 5 points for a little muffin....??
1800362792,147132,2018-10-28,5,I grilled them on the barbeque after simmering. Nice tasting ribs.
2002314120,250024,2018-10-28,1,"Am I something? I count only 6 ingredients-pb, flour, sugar, egg, cinnamon and nutmeg."
2002315207,250903,2018-10-28,5,This was really fun. Made it for an adult Halloween party and everyone ate it up saying it reminded them of childhood. Thinking I should have tried the broiler to get some burnt cheese look... Maybe next time.
2002313158,19871,2018-10-28,3,"I found this to be &quot;okay&quot;, although to be fair, this type of dish isn't my favourite (I don't really like tomato-sauced dishes). So while I found the taste to be a little boring, it was very easy to make. The actual cooking time was super fast, and all in one pot! I'm thinking now that this may taste a lot better if a flavourful sausage was used instead of chicken breast..."
2001557662,283395,2018-10-28,1,"This was a big disappointment. I should have realized that the custard powder would overtake the flavour. The texture was good but one could not eat it, it had a custard taste and not much of an orange taste. I tried it over a few days hoping it would improve then threw the lot out. You would be better thickening with a desertspoon of cornflour."
2002314160,178945,2018-10-28,5,"Did two, one with venison and pork with zucchini for noodles, and one regular one for the gang.... amazing, so good he even did the dishes!"
2002315303,288370,2018-10-28,4,"Used this recipe as a baseline. A little watery.. but turned out well tastewise. Topped w/broccoli cutlets/pepperoni/salami/bologna and mozz/parm cheese. Don pepino pizza sauce, buisquiik crust. Would recommend again."
400708,32194,2018-10-28,5,"No way this recipe is a 5 star; it's for sure a 10 star. What a great sandwich bread and making on the ABM dough setting then taking out to shape and allow for a 2nd rise made for a soft crumb, with a hint of sweetness that makes for a wonderful sandwich bread. As always Donna with your bread recipes - it's the BEST."
2002314551,134270,2018-10-28,5,We made them in a flatter 16 inch circle. Added brushed butter before sugar mixture. Dip in syrup. Wow.
2000443225,83828,2018-10-28,5,"Loved it!! I went a little heavier on the garlic and omitted the worchestershire, both due to personal taste preferences. At the end, I added 2 big handfuls of spinach to the sauce and let it wilt down before removing from heat. Note: if using skinless boneless thighs, I suggest pouring off some of the fat after browning the meat. Enjoy!"
2002314469,45975,2018-10-28,4,"I made this in my instant pot last night and it's terrific. I sauteed the onions in some olive oil first and then browned the kielbasa. Then I added the rest of the ingredients as well as some potatoes. I used high pressure for 20 minutes but next time I will do less time, maybe 10 or 15 minutes. So easy and great for a paleo diet. Thank you!"
2002315159,22133,2018-10-28,5,"thank you for the recipe, it was wonderful! I use my Grandmother's old fashion apple cake but didn't have a recipe for anything with pears. This cake pops with flavor using spices besides the standard cinnamon. The pears were not grainy in texture as they can be when eaten raw. Very moist.I also used whole -wheat pastry flour. I will keep this as my go to for pot luck or holidays. Made x3 already gave out to ppl to try ,excellent responses. thank you Sherry-WI"
2002314612,98273,2018-10-28,5,"I made them two times, the first time I made them they were chocolatey, sweet and just all around delicous!..Although the second time I used some cocoa powder since we ran out of nesquick, and it was a lot more bitter than before, If you want a less-sweet, tastes-more-like-dark-chocolate brownie, add a bit of cocoa powder instead of some of the nesquick"
2002314232,204976,2018-10-28,5,Thank you so much tried the recipe as is for card club...amazing! Tried others before but the roast was too tough. Was asked for the recipe!
2123645,17209,2018-10-28,3,"This was quick and easy, but a little bland. I definitely recommend lightly salting the chicken before browning. We topped our meal with some Parmesan cheese to add more flavor."
2002315224,56846,2018-10-28,0,"If these are made ahead to freeze, should you just freeze the shells without the sauce and use the sauce when you cook them."
302795,373700,2018-10-28,5,"Love ?? this recipe! This is the second or third time I have made this. I tried a different recipe previously, but it had butter in it and it left a film in my mouth. I concur with other comments to use chicken broth instead of water."
2002315153,71344,2018-10-28,5,I used Greek yogurt instead of butter milk. So light and fluffy. Arguing over who could lick the bowl clean. Thank you
1800362792,217414,2018-10-28,5,I've been making this pie for the last 5-6 years. The family says it's a must for Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing.
2002314609,193205,2018-10-28,5,I made this wedding soup yesterday afternoon before taking my daughter trick or treating I let it cook all day on low in my crook pot and when we returned home the soup was done it cooked for 7 hours on low and let it set for 1 hour. The soup was fantastic after coming in from the cold..
708128,74691,2018-10-28,5,"Best Tea Biscuit Recipe. I followed the recipe with no changes. They turned out tall and light. Never will I use another recipe , this is a keeper."
2002280533,214498,2018-10-28,5,I want to substitute extra virgin olive oil for the butter. 1/3 c olive oil is the bakers equivalent to 1/2 c butter??? Anyone who can confirm or deny is welcome. The olive oil leaves them a bit on the flatter side. Can I double the baking powder to compensate? All help is welcome I making the conversion from butter to oil. It came out beautifully. I added 3 tsp anise extract and 2 tsp vanilla extract. With 3 eggs plus 2 yolks
2002315367,25745,2018-10-28,0,"I made it using old bay Seasoning and we didn’t like it at all I made it again but used Louisiana seasoning, it came out delicious"
2002314324,56523,2018-10-28,5,Awesome thanks
1802936715,151234,2018-10-28,3,"Kind of flavorless, but will make again with more seasoning."
12966086,17186,2018-10-28,0,This is the BEST mac &amp; cheese I have ever cooked and eaten. GREAT
482376,211605,2018-10-28,5,"I LOVE this soup! That little bit of cinnamon gives it a delightful taste that makes this really unique. It's just a hint/perfect amount. I love that this has both rice and potatoes, too. Yum all the way around and back again. Thank you!"
2002314154,385268,2018-10-28,5,Even better than Houston’s. Unbelievably delicious.
2002315025,384069,2018-10-28,5,Far exceeded my expectations! Followed the process with the stated ingredients and Voila! I've covered with wax paper and put in the freezer for a bit as someone suggested. Next time I'll put it into a 9x13 pan as it made so much!
2002314576,518772,2018-10-28,0,"A few extra steps, use all breast on bone with skin, brown breast with skin in half olive oil half butter and then remove chicken, saut&eacute; veggies in same pan with drippings add a little butter, substitute 2 cups of the water with a bottle of dry white wine."
2002314200,370578,2018-10-28,5,This recipe is one of my favourites! It's pretty much foolproof and there's never any left over. It's a very moist carrot cake which travels well :)
2002304569,100727,2018-10-28,5,"The best chocolate chip cookie, oh my goodness! I don't modify the recipe at all."
2002314456,44487,2018-10-28,1,This recipe broke my Kitchenaid mixer. You reccomended we use a mixer without the dough hook on high speed. This is really really bad for the mixer and ends up getting the dough stuck in the beater and breaks destroys the gears. Ended up destroying my 250 dollar machine so thanks for the really really horrible advice.
2001955162,121412,2018-10-28,5,"Our local supermarket regularly has fresh catfish pieces, so this is a regular in my house - Sometimes I use panko bread crumbs, and usually add a cajun seasoning mix to it, e.g. paprika, cumin, garlic powder, etf."
2002314709,101454,2018-10-28,5,"I've been using this recipe for years. Always a hit. Sometimes I open a can of Au ju gravy to go with or a jar of mushroom gravy. GREAT TIP: You can make this ahead and freeze. I make this, turn it into a meatloaf shaped pan, cover the pan well with several layers of foil and freeze. I never freeze longer than a week or two. Take out 1 or 2 days before planned use, let is thaw in fridge, flip it over onto a baking sheet (add your ketchup or topping) and bake. You can make a large batch and split between 2 meatloaf pans. Hope this helps"
93911,42256,2018-10-28,5,"These were quite yummy. They ended up kind of thin for me but I’m at 7000 ft, so I don’t know if that had anything to do with it. I didn’t make any adjustments for altitude."
2002315058,140486,2018-10-28,1,"Nothing but complete garbage, followed the recipe to a T and all I got was a donut glaze, too runny to even do anything with and not even fit to put on cupcakes."
505055,167868,2018-10-28,0,How far ahead can I make the cream dressing?
2002314407,277797,2018-10-28,5,"What a wonderful recipe! I have been using another taco salad recipe, and not happy with it, so I thought I would look around for another. Wow! Am I ever glad I did! I followed all the suggestions, and had my guests make a bed of lettuce in their salad bowl, then add their own chips. The bean/corn mixture was added on top of that, and then bowls of shredded tex-mex cheese, fresh cilantro, lime wedges, guacamole and sour cream were passed around as toppers. Repeated rave reviews, seconds, and left with the recipe. Everyone kept saying how fresh the salad tasted. Here is what I loved: The separation of the chips from the salad until the last second, the sour cream/taco spice dressing, and the fresh cilantro. Yummy!"
2002314309,339905,2018-10-28,5,"So I very rarely do reviews, but this bread IS wonderful. I have never made such a nice light loaf from my bread machine before. The texture is great. I put all the ingredients in before going to bed, used the time delay &amp; dough setting, and in the morning I put it into a normal loaf pan, let it raise and baked it at 325 for 25 mins. Delish!"
2002094991,211710,2018-10-28,5,So easy and delicious! This will be my go to roast recipe. Thank you!!
429816,498729,2018-10-28,5,"This recipe is AMAZING. I have some food sensitivities (egg, flour among many others), so this is a life saver. I couldn't believe how much it tastes like egg foo yong. I subbed 2 T coconut flour and 1/4 c cassava flour for the wheat flour and tamari for the soy sauce, just fyi, and it was still great, and I'm positive it would be great with original ingredients too. I pan fried a couple patties and baked the others, and all were good. Thank You for posting this recipe, it gave me back an old time favorite takeout item!!!!!!"
2002314247,250325,2018-10-28,5,"These are 3 great recipes for sausage. I used steak, pork loin, and bacon. Leftersover's. I doubled the spices and used fresh Sage and Cyanne from the garden."
2002314967,301754,2018-10-28,5,"I made this for the first time, yesterday! It is delicious and yummy..perfect for a cool autumn night. However, rather than having an issue with it being too soupy, mine was too thick. My only conclusion is that I used huge potatoes rather than large ones...though...they seemed perfect to me! Will make this again and again!! Yuuummmmyyyy!!!"
2002314614,274504,2018-10-28,5,"Super Delicious! Easy to make, light, airy, fluffy &amp; buttery! Just the way we’ve always eaten peanut brittle growing up in New Orleans and when visiting Mississippi. Yummy, Yummy Peanut Brittle"
2002314334,192346,2018-10-28,5,"These cookies taste great! They are very hearty, can only eat 2 at a time. Hopefully they increase milk supply. I normally pump between 2-3 oz. I added white chocolate chips and also rainbow sprinkles to the mix."
2001246894,2526,2018-10-28,4,"I made this several months ago, using duck breast. I followed the directions exactly, and it came out very much like our local restaurant used to fix, bit not quite. I'm going to fix it again this week and follow the &quot;club soda&quot; and peanut oil and almond extract. However, I'll keep the mushrooms, using fresh instead of canned to keep the moisture content low. This is one of my favorite ways to make duck breast. Yum!"
2000944409,536475,2018-10-28,0,"Being on Atkins, I would use diced cauliflower instead of potatoes. Sounds delish and will make tomorrow. Or maybe tonight for dinner."
1179225,456988,2018-10-28,5,"Great recipe! We really liked these. I only made a 1/4 of the recipe since there was only 2 of us, but I should have made the whole recipe so we could enjoy the leftovers. Thanks for sharing!"

2002314215,231446,2018-10-28,4,I made 1/2 recipe and we'll have to eat it at least twice. Used this as a side dish with stuffed peppers. Very good.
1902211,253116,2018-10-28,0,I wish they'd give a recipe converted to Tablespoons and Cup measurements
2002315175,360528,2018-10-28,5,"Wanted to test this recipe after reading it after so many 5 star comments! Well I made it tonight and it really is the bet mac n cheese I've made ever! It reminds me of the mac n cheese you would get in a cafeteria style restaurant which reminds me of my childhood. I halved this recipe and only used 4 tbls of butter and less than 2 cups of cheddar cheese and it was PLENTY cheesy. Very, Very good!"
2001987765,424391,2018-10-28,5,Add one pkg Birds Eye frozen coconut Soooo good
2000180342,24952,2018-10-28,5,"This really amazed me. I had a recipe that called for soup mix. I am not happy about the salt in the commercial product so I rarely buy it. After I mixed the ingredients together, I tasted it and it really is so close, any difference is negligible. Most likely, I will never spend money on that product again. As a matter of fact, I plan to pre-mix some for my cooking and I can now use it more often. Thanks a bunch!"
2002314637,331480,2018-10-28,0,Best pie ever. I added a dash of vanilla and a 1/4 cup more sugar. I only used raw cane sugar. I sliced my apples super thin with a mandolin.
2002315207,140284,2018-10-28,5,These were fun and simple for my Halloween party. I dyed the mustard green with a little bit of food coloring and used little cheese stuffed sausages and jalape&ntilde;o sausages since it was for grown ups.

2123645,219768,2018-10-28,4,Very good! The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender. We served it over rice to soak up the yummy lemony sauce.
2002314270,287513,2018-10-28,2,I found this recipe to be very dry...I tried adding water to help but it still wasn't great. Not really that impressed.
2001796296,71849,2018-10-28,5,Amazing recipe! Thank you so much. They were a bit crumbly but we love them that way!
2002314365,349246,2018-10-28,4,"It turned out pretty good! I added chocolate chips before microwaving, and caramel syrup with a sprinkle of salt on top after microwaving, and it's not too shabby! It'll definitely do in a pinch when you don't have any milk or eggs for a regular cake/brownie recipe. My husband gobbled it up!"
1179225,55967,2018-10-28,5,We really liked these! I thought they would need cheese and seasoning in the tomato sauce but the recipe was perfect as written. I didn't have any chives so I substituted parsley. Thanks for sharing the keeper recipe!
2002314256,125417,2018-10-28,5,Great recipe. I made the beef version and it tastes just like I remember as a kid in Holland. I used beef stock instead of water. Consistency was perfect and they didn’t split.
2002314431,507763,2018-10-28,5,"So delicious, used bourbon"
910147,142303,2018-10-28,5,"Definitely mix in sliced black olives to the cornbread topping, if possible! This looks the old family favorite recipe of ours (except for the olives). Great comfort food for winter, and you can also use ground chicken or turkey."

2002314116,139499,2018-10-27,4,"1. Substituted oil for butter. 2. Doubled amount of baking powder. 3. Used WHOLE FRESH cranberry. Did not soak it. Added a little bit more berries, I love them. 4. Added zest of 1 whole orange and still barely can taste it. 1 tsp is too little. 5. Started at 400F, then lowered to 350. Checked twice. LOVE IT!"

2002313957,230926,2018-10-27,2,"My family really did not enjoy these, which is surprising given the 5* rating. Firstly, the mixture was way too wet - needed another cup of SR flour to get it to a point that it could be kneeded without sticking like slime to my hands. Secondly, they taste like scones, not the usual bready scrolls from coles and bakers delight. Thirdly, the oven temp is too hot, as another commenter mentioned, they go very dark on the outside and are still doughy on the inside. I don’t think I’ll be using this recipe again."
2329451,112901,2018-10-27,5,"Really delicious and a big hit at the office Halloween party! First time I’ve cooked with apples, too!"
2002313708,111722,2018-10-27,0,"It was delicious! Since I enjoy eating spinach I added spinach, real bacon bits, sharp cheddar and French fried onions! Each time we have an office function with food, it is always welcome! Thanks for sharing"

2002313158,15875,2018-10-27,4,"I think I overboiled my chicken as it was chewy. I also omitted the jalapeno and just put a tad more cayenne which was definitely enough kick. Recipe doubled fine. Our Chinese students, who are very picky, actually loved this dish."
2002313984,297981,2018-10-27,5,"I liked how it came out, but I added some green peppers. Delicious..."
2000902398,392859,2018-10-27,4,"A good stew. I did bake it for 2 hours. Added fresh thyme, 3 garlic cloves, and some fresh chopped tomatoes (3),a couple carrots, a turnip and potatoes to it."

2002313664,38298,2018-10-27,5,"It's different every time because I always adjust the amounts, but it is still awesome with every tweak. I frequently leave the bacon out and occasionally add a few diced hard-boiled eggs."
2002313853,63528,2018-10-27,0,Can these be frozen for a week or two (with or without glaze)?
2000293071,155744,2018-10-27,5,Good recipe to start from. I love that the recipe calls for 1/8&quot; slices of red onion and the photo shows onions that are at least 1/4&quot; thick. Made me chuckle. :)
2795402,470290,2018-10-27,5,This is the exact same recipe that used to be on the back of the Brer Rabbit Molasses bottle. I had that recipe memorized when I was a kid in 4-H. First year 4-H I entered these cookies as my project. Went to State Fair where I got a blue ribbon. Down through the family several nieces &amp; nephews have also competed in 4-H foods. Naturally this was the recipe they used -- always with excellent results. Also entered these cookies in open class at the fair as an adult -- always with good results. THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER!!!
2002308439,100315,2018-10-27,5,"This was a great recipe and turned out perfectly. I tried the tweak with stirring after 5 minutes and it didn’t work for me, but it didn’t matter. Still set great and tasted even better."
157425,472191,2018-10-27,5,This is better then my scalloped potatoes and ham. We had sharp cheddar cheese on hand so used that and did add more to the cream sauce and topping. The peas and herbs de provence were very nice additions. Will be making this again the next time I bake a ham. Made and reviewed for the Think Pink - 2018 tag game.
2002313556,97496,2018-10-27,3,"These have too much cream of tartar, in my opinion. I recommend using less of that and more vanilla extract."

2002313717,298874,2018-10-27,5,"This was so good! It was my first time making gravy and it turned out fantastic. My picky husband and kids made sure there was nothing left! So I made some tweaks. Before starting the gravy, I fried a diced onion in a little bit of oil until browned. I then added the butter and flour to the pot and followed directions from there. I used almond milk instead of cow's milk, and once it was boiling, I threw in some pre-chopped grilled chicken and mixed it all together. Let it sit for a few minutes to thicken, then ladled it over biscuits. This was such a hearty, delicious breakfast. The kids want it again tomorrow morning!"
169430,504284,2018-10-27,5,"Wonderful recipe that I'll certainly be coming back to. My single change was to use 2 small mandarin oranges as I don't think I've ever seen kumquats here in Canada, at least not where I live. Must say that I love the use of saffron here to me it's the quintessential element that put's this over the top. Used a smaller size Israeli couscous and it came out perfectly. I'll make this the next time that I have dinner guests. Thanks so much for a major keeper!"
830384,282620,2018-10-27,1,I would give this a big fat ZERO. but there is not an option Tasteless. I threw it in the trash. Where are your taste buds? This was a waste of good food and now I have to cook something with flavor. Rice and potatoes together -hell no !
2002313522,208945,2018-10-27,5,"Delicious and moist! So easy and enough to share. The flavor takes on a hint of honey, wow."
2002232072,30818,2018-10-27,0,I scrolled down and read previous posts. It's good to see that sugar has been removed from the recipe.
2002313659,388351,2018-10-27,5,"Excellent! Best dumplings ever. Used Self-rising flour +1 tsp baking powder and butter rather than oil and didn’t sift but they were light and fluffy. The thyme was a genius addition. If you’re a chicken and dumpling fan, this recipe is a keeper."
2002313897,467900,2018-10-27,5,These might be the best pancakes I ever made!!! So soft &amp; fluffy! I put only 1 tbs of sugar in &amp; used gluten free flour as I had no rice.. but yum!!! Will definitely be sharing! :-D
1800036218,248111,2018-10-27,5,"I have made this chili for about 25+ years. I originally got the recipe when it was printed in the Knoxville News Sentinel. I have misplaced my copy, googled the recipe and found it on this forum. I boil my chicken first to keep it moist and to make a broth. I then shred it with my Kitchen Aid Mixer while it's still hot. This makes it the perfect consistency. This and the Calhoun's Spinach Maria recipes are my go to recipes. Of course since I never buy either at the restaurant any longer as they just don't measure up to the at-home versions. I hope everyone who tried this enjoys it as much as my family and I do."
2002313149,509504,2018-10-27,5,"We're at 10200 ft. These cookies are solid, classic, delicious. 10/10"
2002313164,312992,2018-10-27,5,This sauce was so delicious. I could just eat it with a spoon. It’s addictive!! We dipped crispy tofu in it... I need to make it again soon!
2001996738,375330,2018-10-27,0,Can I use dried basil....fresh not available
2002313054,41260,2018-10-27,1,"Not a good recipe at all. Had good hopes after reading reviews, followed recipe to a T and they came our doughy and un-flavorful. Looking back at the omittance of some baking staples and ratio at which the ingredients were called for in the recipe, I should have seen this failure coming."
2002313306,223069,2018-10-27,0,I added nuts and I substituted vanilla with coconut ice cream and it’s awesome!
2002058971,465019,2018-10-27,0,This cake is amazingly moist and delicious!
2002313422,87537,2018-10-27,0,"This is basically the recipe I use, minus the Worcestershire. What I can't figure out is how you get 24 meatballs out of one lb of beef. I use 3# and get 24. They must be the size of marbles."
2914865,178611,2018-10-27,0,You need a proofreader. Very hard to follow ambiguous ingredients/directions.
239758,249499,2018-10-27,5,"Hubby, who eats a granny smith apple every day, loved this soup, but the apple made it just a bit too sweet for me. I did love the way it incorporated four vegetables. That's always a big plus in my book. Also, I needed to add an extra cup or so of water to create enough broth."
2000686836,384905,2018-10-27,0,I only use Golden Mushroom. I gives your juices (gravy) a darker tone and is delicious.
2002313112,512818,2018-10-27,3,"This is a decent recipe, but doesn't compare to P.F. Changs. The peppers and onions get too soft and mushy in the crockpot. The flavor is good, but I think it would be better with minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I might try the recipe again, but cook it all in a frying pan and skip the crockpot altogether!"
126440,277320,2018-10-27,5,Delicious Salad! Loved it. I did add Chicken breast to serve and we will have this all the time.
372791,24799,2018-10-27,5,I add a tablespoon of vinegar to the water for easy peeling. Scientifically the vinegar begins to break down the shell so it makes sense to me. Otherwise this method gives perfectly boiled eggs every time.
1179225,32295,2018-10-27,5,Turned out Great! I used veggie broth and just needed to use about a cup more to keep it from going dry. Loved how all the flavors came together. Thanks or sharing the recipe.
2002305063,429838,2018-10-27,0,"I used good can tomatoes, slice fresh garlic using a razor blade, if you like garlic try this. Excellent flavor."
2002313786,295413,2018-10-27,5,I really enjoyed my time at the winery and was overjoyed that they shared the recipe for the goat cheese spread So readily when asked. My friends and family love it and will go to visit when out visiting the area for sure.
2002313365,22104,2018-10-27,5,"Great flavor, texture is thick but not too thick. Spice is just enough to keep it interesting but not overpowering. Will definitely make this again."
735753,106467,2018-10-27,5,I use sour cream instead of heavy cream and love it every time. I also leave out the water.
2002313733,528654,2018-10-27,4,I put 2/3 caramels in a cup and heated it in the microwave until melted. Then I scooped a little bit up with a knife (making it a long strand) and waited for it to cool. I didn't burn my fingers! No matter what I did the nuts would not stick! So I tried with Reeses pieces ;) and they still look very cute!
2002314081,26420,2018-10-27,5,No need to ever buy cocktail sauce again.
2002275259,131639,2018-10-27,5,Made this exactly as recipe and it was perfection. Hands down the best tomato soup I have ever eaten. Will be making this all winter. My husband doesn't care for soup too much and he is hunting this weekend so my daughter and I are having soup weekend. This was our first and will be hard to top.
305531,257150,2018-10-27,5,"Such a yummy side dish. Simple and good. Thanks for sharing, Lynn."
2002313705,109737,2018-10-27,0,"This recipe is awesome. The bread is light and delicate, I didn't expect that with cream cheese in the recipe. I love it! It's worthy of 5 stars."
2002313121,335304,2018-10-27,5,Did em doing. Sponge night before next day dough rested in frig for 4 hrs then boiled &amp;Baked 6 onion 6 garlic spot on with high gluten flour this recipe is a keeper this photo was taking at about only 14 minutes of cooking I did put my bread stone and a cast iron skilled filled with water and a spray bottle of water to mist in between turns going to make a ham&amp; cheese on bagel for dinner then a new york Breakfast sandwich in morning heated bagel then butter then 2 fryed eggs over easy ham and cheese. Salt pepper ketchup can't wait for morning
2002313450,187362,2018-10-27,4,"The flavor was really nice and they definitely were fluffy, almost so much the insides wouldn't cook through. I've had a lot of pumpkin pancakes and these just weren't my favourite."
305531,258505,2018-10-27,5,"Quick, simple soup. This was good on a cool, fall day. Thanks for sharing."
2002313450,140878,2018-10-27,2,"Like reviewer Lovetorun62, I didn't have any liquid smoke, so I used worchestershire. The meat WAS tender and juicy, but SO SALTY! I will try it again with liquid smoke and probably half the salt and see if it's better next time."
767039,531161,2018-10-27,0,"3 Ingredients? Plus four spices , not to mention the seven or eight ingredients for serving. But carnitas is not just braised pork (roasted in liquid). So without the extra ingredients (the spices), there is very little flavor.. I actually like your recipe, it tasted great, but it is not a 3-ingredient recipe."
2002313097,48974,2018-10-27,5,"This was great! I followed the recipe to the T, and it turned out so good! I put the finished product in the blender and used it as a sauce/gravy for a roast, and it’s so good!"
2002314106,523450,2018-10-27,1,"Made this tonite. Very disappointed. Looked good but tasted bland. My husband thought something was missing, like sherry!"
2002313144,24712,2018-10-27,5,"I made this for supper tonight and oh my goodness! It was SO good! I used 1 large can of chicken and one small can of chicken. I used a little more rice, carrots and onion than what the recipe called for. I also used more of the chicken broth base &amp; seasoning (low sodium) instead of the bouillon cube and about 4 TBLS of lemon juice. It was the perfect amount of everything. The lemon was strong enough to taste it but not too strong. I’ve ordered lemon rice soup at Greek restaurants, thinking I was going to get an awesome bowl of soup and more often than not, it’s been ‘meh’ and I’ve been disappointed. I guess I’ll just have to make my own when I get a hankering for lemon rice soup."
885024,509877,2018-10-26,5,i love these! pioneer woman does it again.
2001976950,498549,2018-10-26,5,"baked up great, looks pretty, tastes yummy Made 12 Didn't have buttermilk but used sour milk instead."
2002206163,454787,2018-10-26,0,Using parchment paper instead of husks did that work out ok
2002312220,99476,2018-10-26,0,Ive made this a couple times now and if ive changed anything its by adding more vegetables. Absolutely delicious!
2002312246,40208,2018-10-26,5,and all of the ingredients are common things most people should have on hand. I used to small bone-in roasts instead of one. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I covered the meat only halfway instead of nearly all the way as instructed. It probably took me about 6 tablespoons of flour to get the gravy thick instead of one fourth cup. I served it with mashed potatoes and it was yummy!
2002312928,145038,2018-10-26,0,"To the person Darlene J, who demanded how many cups of this or that to use - well, why can't you just use tablespoon measures where required, and cup measures where required. It's not rocket science. Surely you have spoons and cups! This turned out great for me. I just added some chilie flakes, for a kick, and used sunflower oil instead of olive oil as I don't the taste of it."
2000372514,361216,2018-10-26,0,EASY &amp; YUMMY....Happen to have everything on hand except I only had smoked paprika. Perfect with instant flavor!
2002312978,35659,2018-10-26,1,No-- called my mama and ingredients were way off I want / need the real thing!
2380036,293657,2018-10-26,5,"We love this recipe. Have you ever done it with fresh grated potatoes? I have a few health nuts in my house. We're not afraid of good fats so the bacon, eggs and cheese are great but I try to avoid processed foods and the tater tots generally have extras. Do you think I could substitute fresh grated potato????"
198154,69983,2018-10-26,4,"If you use fresh pumpkin pur&eacute;e instead of canned, l recommend cutting back on the vegetable oil a bit. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing."
2002093000,462405,2018-10-26,5,"Great idea! I made my own guacamole, we're not fans of sliced tomatoes on burgers, but a small one (I prefer Roma) diced in a fresh made guac is great. We also like the heat so used pepper Jack/cheddar cheese combo!"
1052873,245490,2018-10-26,5,The mayo was a little weird. Maybe because I had 1/2 actual mayo and half miracle whip. I used basil farmer's cheese. Nice and warm and melty.
2002312519,102404,2018-10-26,0,My Mom used to make this.I did one time by her recipe and lost it So happy I found this. Exactly like my Mom's Thanks so much
2002312873,109699,2018-10-26,5,"This recipe is the closest I have found to the original maid-rite. I have eaten many of these from the Quincy, IL maid-rite restaurant. One person wrote it was dry, she cooked out too much of the broth. People who added corn starch to thicken it, it's suppose to be loose meat. Thank you for the recipe, I love it!"
2000241996,112844,2018-10-26,4,"I liked this a lot, though it does turn out sweeter than I'd prefer, which I believe is 100% a result of the Jiffy mix. If I were to make again, I would use a Jiffy copycat recipe and reduce/remove the sugar to make this more savory. It's also somewhere between a cornbread and a cornmeal quiche due to the amount of eggs and cheese in it. (However, I wholly recommend mixing in some extra cheddar and maybe even some bacon. And garlic - always garlic.)"
1179225,62459,2018-10-26,5,What a treat! I love how simple this was to make and it really hit the spot as a cozy dessert. I used my own canned pears instead of peaches. I bet this would work with any fruit. So good! Thanks or sharing the recipe!
2002312783,118986,2018-10-26,5,"I've had this same recipe from a 1960s Kerr canning recipe book; I make it annually, never had a failure. For a 'different' jelly, I've also used it with alternative juices. There's several apple- combinations now available, i.e., raspberry, grape, cranberry, to name a few. I can it in 4-oz jars for my Christmas giving; they're always well received."
2001893917,210708,2018-10-26,0,What restaurant use to serve this ?
2001183009,42262,2018-10-26,5,"Delicious! I made a few changes. I used lowfat mayo (all I had), added a tspn of dijon mustard, left out mushrooms, doubled the cracker crumbs (accidentally). I made 24 tiny quiches, which needed about 18 minutes in the oven. (Let them cool before trying to remove them from the pan.) I plan to make more for a party next week. This recipe is a keeper!"
2001836569,103611,2018-10-26,5,Delicious with maple sausage!
2002312305,59310,2018-10-26,1,Way way way too much salt. Like I dont think you should add any. I have to throw out the cupcakes cause they are that bad. I do think that if you dont put the salt in they would taste good though.
2002312725,533699,2018-10-26,0,I found the skull pan online at Target for $9.99.
2002312365,69212,2018-10-26,5,Awesome! Made it and it was great. Although our Hatch chilis were very hot. They were fresh and made it even better! Great American Land and Cattle can't make it this good!!
2002243872,249514,2018-10-26,5,I made this tonight and it was delicious. I used pecans instead of walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe as written. The reduced sauce was perfection! Easy enough for a weeknight and elegant enough for company. Yum.
128473,227531,2018-10-26,5,Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe Fluffster. I enjoyed this lovely treat very much. It was quick and easy to make with excellent results. It was so flavorful and had a great texture. Made for Think Pink 2018
2001402443,91039,2018-10-26,5,This was an amazing marinade. I put mine in the oven with six peeled potatoes at 375 and they turned out wonderfully together. Perfect meal. Will definitely make again.
2002312290,179478,2018-10-26,5,"Absolutely delicious and easy. Instead of granulated sugar, used 1/3 cup brown sugar plus ~1/4 cup honey, with none sprinkled on top, and it's sweet without being too sweet. Will definitely make again."
323186,63459,2018-10-26,5,"Loved this, I used bacon, not quite sure why mine looks so much more tomatey than the others, I did stick to recipe :) very good and much enjoyed, thank you! A Think Pink event recipe :)"
198154,44995,2018-10-26,5,"I didn't have any fresh parsley on hand. So, to save a trip to the store, I used 2 teaspoons of dried parsley. I also used a garlic salt and pepper blend. They turned out fantastic!"
2001257109,179865,2018-10-26,5,Great blend of flavors. Was looking for greens 'n beans but not a soup. This was just perfect. Thank you for posting.
2002312248,465655,2018-10-26,5,This is delicious and easily made in a pressure cooker or Instant Pot.
1803650059,186437,2018-10-26,5,"D E L I S H !!!!! It was the first coleslaw dressing that came up on Google and I was extremely pleased....so was my other half! And, BTW, it was delicious in only 1 hour, cuz that's all the time I had. I changed the mayo to half mayo, half Miracle whip and used 2 packets of Splenda. I only had a 14 oz bag of coleslaw so I halfed the recipe. Used small amount of celery salt cuz I don't have celery seed. I liked it so much that I will make it again in a few days. Thank You Aunt Willie !!!!"
2000005176,418070,2018-10-26,5,These turn out great ever time I make them. I do have to add a 1/4 more of flour so I can work them into balls with my hands. My husbands co workers always ask for them too.
128473,248350,2018-10-26,5,"Wow, wow, wow. What a treat, so comforting. Made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I went with the carrot option as I was out of red peppers. I can't wait to make this again; it was so good, it has already been requested again. Made with pleasure for Autumn Fever"
2002312566,2986,2018-10-26,3,"I don't know where this recipe came from, but Goldwater's recipe that was published when he said Texans (president Johnson) don't know chili, had some rather odd ingredients"
2002312814,164726,2018-10-26,5,I've made this too many times to count. Followed the recipe exactly as it is written. This turns out perfect every time and my family LOVES it. You can't go wrong with this one
2002312979,43285,2018-10-26,5,"I'm new to bread baking, and this is a wonderful recipe to start with. I don't have a stand mixer, but I could use a hand-held with no problem. No baking stone needed, no loaf pans. I used coffee instead of water, and demerara sugar. Excellent flavor. Baked 25 minutes, it came out perfectly."
400708,513434,2018-10-26,5,"Great Fall breakfast recipe. I had to sub WW Flour with all-purpose as that's what I had, then made as directed. Grinding half of the pecans insured that the pecan flavor was throughout the pancakes, and then the chopped gave that much enjoyed crunch. For topping I heated pure maple syrup with about 2 tablespoons of butter and when heated through stirred in the sliced banana, light, fluffy and enjoyed by all. A true winner recipe"
957116,481146,2018-10-26,5,My husband still claims these are the reason he married me! Took them to him on our first date!
111075,184552,2018-10-26,0,Fast and fabulous! Definitely a go-to recipe from now on in my kitchen. The brownies only needed 4 minutes in my MW which made the whole workload six minutes for me. Can't ask for faster when you're pressed for time. Thanks for sharing a winner!
1179225,212784,2018-10-26,5,"Excellent! The perfect dinner for a drizzly fall night. The only changes I made were to use a tablespoon of nutritional yeast, 1 cup of chopped parsley and 2 teaspoons of veggie soup base. After I dded the flour to the onion I cooked it a little to get the flour slightly cooked and then added the Bragg's and cooked a minute longer and then dumped everything else in. I'm only mentioning this because it turned out so well I would like the same results next time I make this delicious recipe. I served it over whipped mashed potatoes and we loved it! Thanks for sharing the keeper recipe!"
2001931883,64211,2018-10-26,3,"The chicken was very tender however the sodium level is off the charts with the cream soups and onion soup mix. Also, with the potatoes, I wouldn't serve with rice. I based my rating on recipe as written. I would use fresh onions and low sodium soups or make my own gravy."
128473,480199,2018-10-26,5,"Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe my friend. It was so good. Even Mr. Picky enjoyed this lovely treat. Made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I did add the optional hot sauce, truly spectacular. The shrimp and corn cakes with mayo was quick and easy to make. The sauce was out of this world good while the cakes were crisp and crunchy on the outside and soft, tender and flavorful on the inside. I will be making this often. Made for Think Pink 2018."
5890033,89503,2018-10-26,2,"Sorry, after cooking for 10 minutes the chicken was not cooked. Also, after adding additional seasoning, they were bland."
2002312851,24153,2018-10-26,5,I made these and added marshmallow to the middle after they were on the pan
2000082350,14756,2018-10-26,5,My grandma used to make these every year for Christmas. When she passed away in 1995 nobody ever got the recipe. She never had it wrote down. I tried so many and just wasn't the same. I tried this recipe and wow it brought back the memories. She was pure Canadian and these are the way they're supposed to be made. They're coming back for Christmas.
2002312308,22782,2018-10-26,1,You've got to be kidding. 2000 mg of sodium? Don't think so.
2002139329,426683,2018-10-26,5,This was surprisingly flavorful and filling. Easy to make and heats up well as leftovers. I'm very impressed.
2002311843,108105,2018-10-25,5,"When I find an interesting recipe I usually read reviews. I haven't till know responded. Usually if its good there are enough responses in favor. But this one was different. Its so good and easy I had to comment. I have made this now for 6 months. I've used fresh and ground ginger. Both work but fresh is the way to go. I have whoever changed to bite size pieces from a boneless skinless breast. It hit a on every note, sweet, salty, acidic and heat. On my rotation for sure."
2002311822,108315,2018-10-25,5,"Amazing! A few years ago my mom and I went out to a little bit more of an upscale restaurant for lunch. We got the soup of the day , lamb and lentil. They charged about $10 per bowl, after the meal I was determined to find a recipe for it and this is it. It turned out amazing. I bought a lamb roast and ground it up myself. My mom and I were amazed by how spot on the recipe is from the resturants special. Fast forward to today, 10/25/2018 we found some lamb we put in the freezer. We were going to just have it grilled up. However it didn't defrost in time so we are so looking forward to making this soup for dinner tomorrow. Cue mouth watering ??"
2010718,464092,2018-10-25,4,"If you think you have to be brave to try this recipe because of the allspice &amp; cinnamon, actually it tastes pretty good with a subtle spice effect. I left out the garlic because we were all anxious to eat, in which case perhaps it could had earned five stars, but I confess that I wanted something with both okra and cheese."
2002189122,134318,2018-10-25,4,"Overall, it was good. Next time, I will add a dash now salt and more seasoning and spices. Also, I broiled it slightly to brown the top."
2002311591,457947,2018-10-25,0,"To answer the question What is sweet chile powder? Sweet Chili Powder is a different from most other chili powders as it possesses a light touch of sweetness. ... Hand blended from freshly ground Ancho and New Mexico Chiles, coriander, cumin, domestic paprika, oregano, garlic, sugar and cinnamon."
2002311587,496992,2018-10-25,3,"It wasn't too bad for me, but it was springy, kinda that springy rubbery texture, and more cake like for me. Not at all fudgy... But maybe i overbaked it? or because I baked them in cupcake pan?"
2002311385,62130,2018-10-25,5,"The second time I made these, instead of almond extract I tried a half teaspoon of New Mexican red chile powder. Buttery vanilla and with a touch of sweet spicy heat."
2002312078,22691,2018-10-25,1,"Followed the recipe that was tweaked by adding more fruit, reducing the sugar on top and in the cobbler, and the liquid to only 1 cup, but the batter never came to the top, sat on the bottom and is very dense. Frustrating! Maybe we'll just scrape the fruit off the top and eat that!"
2002312133,39087,2018-10-25,4,nice
137477,113751,2018-10-25,3,"These are tasty and flavorful, but are not soft and chewy as the title says. I made them exactly as directed, but ended up with a crunchy cookie."
483728,221492,2018-10-25,5,I made this as recipe states. It was very good and I made it in 15 minutes. Very tasty. I ate it with crusty rolls
2001779573,146732,2018-10-25,5,"I used three times the garlic, substituted fine ricotta for the sour cream and half &amp; half for the cream. Also added cinnamon and a squeeze of orange to cut the fat and add a little sweetness. Start to finish this took under 20 minutes. Could be nice with a little sausage cooked down with the aromatics."
384210,456482,2018-10-25,5,Made lomo saltado from a cookbook and was going to post it but this recipe is almost exactly the same (my recipe used a bit more vinegar than this one). It turned out delicious!
2002312179,119152,2018-10-25,5,I doubled the soup and coffee because I wanted there to be enough liquid to cook potatoes and carrots. That's the only change I made and it was delicious...a huge hit with the whole family. The gravy would be good for beef or pork at well. This one is a keeper.
2002206676,78123,2018-10-25,5,I was looking for a new chili recipe. I tasted a sweet chili at a recent community chili cook-off. This one is terrific. Just a little bite from the jalapeno. Used only &frac14; cup of honey. Wonderful taste.
2002311325,192346,2018-10-25,4,Can this dough be frozen?
955706,446331,2018-10-25,5,I added 1 apple to the pot and mashed the vegtables and returned to the gravy. Slightly thickened with cornstarch. Would like to try juniper berrys just to see the outcome.
2002311939,283373,2018-10-25,5,"My teenage son loves these. We make them with dried cranberries instead of raisins and sprinkle a few mini choc chips on top. And the recipe works out just fine if you use regular (vs natural style) peanut butter. Only minus is the need for refrigeration, but we keep them in the freezer and they are fine for him to take to school. On my list is to try them w almond (not peanut) butter and maybe some cold coffee instead of the H2O"
2002311650,530500,2018-10-25,5,"Sounds delicious! Please Pete be so kind as to tell us, if this oil is made in advance can it be used for a week or two weeks without losing too much of its potential? Should it be refrigerated? Or should only the freshly prepared one be used? Thank you!"
2002311844,385177,2018-10-25,5,"I used evaporated milk instead of water, added pecans, and topped with a simple sugar glaze! It was a hit! Thank you, this recipe is a keeper"
2000162245,133812,2018-10-25,4,Made this last night for dinner and it was really good! My first time making scalloped potatoes that weren't from a box lol. Despite adding a few more seasonings I felt it needed just a bit more &quot;something&quot;. I will definitely be making it again but will add some extra salt and other seasonings. I used an 8x8 baking pan and they took about one hour to cook. Thank you for the recipe!
2001297534,264256,2018-10-25,5,I didn't have frozen corn in butter sauce so I used frozen corn and added a tablespoon of butter. Being a couple members of the family do not like the taste of bell pepper I didn't use it and doubled the amount of celery. I also used whole milk instead of skimmed. The results were a tasty chowder which every one liked. Thanks for sharing.
2002312096,87205,2018-10-25,5,Great cake! I have my students make this every year at least 2-3 times...once (maybe twice) for themselves then other times for school events. I have them add 1 cup chocolate chips at the end before they pour it the bundt pan. Any cake mix and any pudding will work great as well. We just dust it powdered sugar before serving...DELICIOUS!
2002311839,272221,2018-10-25,0,What do u mean by 10 times the sugar
34122,65911,2018-10-25,5,We really enjoyed this even though I only had 30 minutes to marinate. I didn’t have orange zest so added a splash of orange juice. I reduced the coriander and curry to 1/2 t each and it was just right. It was done in 30 minutes at 350. A nice change from the usual pork loin recipes. I served this with broccoli and white rice.
2156777,28261,2018-10-25,5,"I love this recipe and crave it constantly. Forgot to rate it years ago, but here it is now :)."
2002311386,13619,2018-10-25,1,This was terrible. I have made pie dough all my life and have one recipe i always use which is Great. The dough was so tough we couldnt eat it!. I never overwork pie dough in fact i dont knead or work it at all just enough to mix ingredients so thats not an excuse. Please redo the recipe cause i wont make it again. I will use my go-to tried and true!
2002311467,158206,2018-10-25,5,"Wow! This is a great, simple recipe for a go-to party finger food. Pigs in a blanket with store bought crescent rolls always taste just like what they are--synthetic ingredients out of a can. This dough is super easy to put together. To ensure you have the right consistency, weigh your flour instead of scooping it. One cup of all-purpose flour = 4.25 oz. If you don't have a scale, make sure you sift your flour into the measuring cup instead of scooping. I like to use full fat buttermilk for best texture and flavor. Don't overstir the dough when combining, as that will result in a tougher biscuit. I brush my biscuits with melted butter as soon as I pull them out of the oven. Yum! Thank you for such a simple yet delicious recipe! I used Lil Smokies and served these for breakfast, but plan on using them for lots of other get-togethers!"
175824,397228,2018-10-25,5,these were somewhat time consuming. I made 24 deviled eggs. I had a hard time getting the olives to stay on nicely. I finally cut them on a paper towel and let them dry a bit. they were much easier to put on. I also added diced up gherkins and scallions.
2002128044,50979,2018-10-25,5,"VERY GOOD - with the following adjustments made from comments made here: About seasoning the chicken breasts.. use a little salt, pepper, a pinch of oregano, ground marjoram and thyme (I don't measure so use &quot;some&quot;) I cooked the chicken on the stove, and added Pancetta (not prosciutto) to the first stage of the saut&eacute;ed ingredients -- this is a major bonus to the flavor -- DOUBLE THE SAUCE (or triple it!) it was fabulously good."
2002311530,41672,2018-10-25,5,For the last person it says food processor or blender so yes use your blender.
2002311251,199579,2018-10-25,5,Made exactly as written and it’s delicious! A picky boy of mine loved it and had seconds(seconds=a success!!) Will definitely add this into the dinner rotation!
2002311578,174582,2018-10-25,0,I want to see recipe of chinese steamed cake
2002311812,513173,2018-10-25,5,"A great way to avoid my organic leeks from going to waste! Had all the ingredients in stock. Turned it into a meal, by adding cooked sausage, browned mushrooms and brocolli! Had it for dinner, and 2 quart containers to bring for lunches. Heated up nicely"
2002311276,60350,2018-10-25,4,It's a good recipe. I I did as the directions call for I found that it didn't have that good of a cheese taste it might have been the type of shredded cheese I used. I tried adding an extra cup of cheese and a few seasonings it helped with the flavor but my issue was the consistency. It was very thick but it still beats that cheap mac and cheese in a box with the powder cheese. definitely would try this recipe again but more than likely will try a different cheese to see if the results differ. Thank you for this recipe and I hope you all have a wonderful day
424131,351062,2018-10-25,5,This was the best meatloaf! Will make again often.
1800039992,299527,2018-10-25,5,"I have fixed this about 6 times and everybody just loves it. We have only used it as a dip but I would like to try it on tacos. My daughter from Georgia took the recipe and added chicken broth and made soup out of it. She said was it delicious. I will try that next time. So very easy and sooo good. I am now sending it to my other daughter in Naples, FL and another in N.C."
2001993143,80647,2018-10-25,3,"Don't have to make the recipe to tell you the problems with it. The ingredients are good, no problem there. The execution though. Use cast iron, you don't sear in a normal roasting pan. It also shouldn't sear as long as it says, nor should you cook it nearly as long and hot as he says. Not even close. Lower to 250-275 and use a temperature probe to cook to desired doneness, but anything over 140 is going to get tough. And honestly, I want to take off another star for the directions to tell someone to use long sleeves for searing. I'm guessing he also needs to be told not to use a blower dryer in the shower."
2001966606,153891,2018-10-25,5,Added more cayenne bc I like it spicier and omitted the thyme and oregano. Great taste! Dipped in Blue Cheese
2002311691,345090,2018-10-25,0,"I would caution everyone to use a GF flour like Cup4Cup, or perhaps whatever GF flour you use that DOES have Xanthan Gum in it, to take out 1/2 cup of the flour and replace it with 1/2 cup of Tapioca Starch. Tapioca starch gives ELASTICITY to dough and would greatly assist in this aspect of making pierogi, or ravioli, etc. The issue with GF flours is that they are missing what gives dough elasticity."
2002312110,129040,2018-10-25,3,these were very very crumbly
2001346577,27208,2018-10-25,5,I've tried so many pot roast recipes but never found one I thought was outstanding until I came upon THIS! I followed the instructions to the letter and it was the best I've ever had! There are only two of us so I cut it in half and it worked perfectly. I ran across another that is identical other than it has you mix the water into the combined mixes first. I tried that and it did not come out as well. I also bought a much cheaper roast so that could be the problem. I'm making this tonight! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!
2002018170,508734,2018-10-25,5,These are what my grandma made with her chicken paprikash. Thank you.
2002311371,132263,2018-10-25,1,Made an account just to say these tasted like POISON. 2 table spoons of baking powder?!!! I knew this would be a mistake but stupidly trusted the recipe
2478607,250063,2018-10-25,5,"Perfectly scrumptious! I just did something different tonight - I browned the butter! Oh my goodness...browning the butter first took these bars to another level. When I make these bars, I always quadruple the recipe!! Thank you, Paula!"
2002038893,495292,2018-10-25,3,"I cut the recipe in half since there are only 2 of us. It turned out more like a soup. I added cut up carrots for some veggies, used previously cooked cut up chicken breast. I would delete the butter. Just added fat and calories not needed."
2002311633,463708,2018-10-25,3,"This cake was quick and easy to make. After 1 hour it smelled like it was done, and after checking I felt that a half hour longer would have dried it out too much as the sides were already dry enough, however I couldn't see on the recipe what size cake pan to use. The cake didn't rise much. I didn't have many sultanas left so I mixed in some cranberries too and the recipe didn't specify what type of sugar so I used 3/4 cup unpacked brown sugar as I didn't want it to be too sweet. I used the almond essence and sprinkled a few sliced almonds on top. Mine definitely wouldn't serve 14 people, I used a round 8&quot; cake pan and cut it into 8. I would have liked the recipe to use the same unit of measure instead of switching from g to cups, that way it's easier to determine if you want to adjust any volumes. Overall this cake turned out delicious, light and moist."
2002304429,323897,2018-10-25,5,Add an extra 1/2 cup of water and it’ll turn out perfect.
2002311237,32142,2018-10-25,0,"I added 1/4 cup of diced celery, 1/4 cup diced carrots, more salt and pepper, 1/2 cup more water to help cook celery and carrots. a pinch of Cheyenne pepper and added a little shredded extra sharp cheddar while cooking. tastes great"
2002311793,11577,2018-10-25,4,"I often put veggies in my scrambled egg, it puts a healthy and flavorful spin on the somewhat boring scrambled eggs. I steam my veggies in advance and finely dice them; any combination of onions, mushrooms, cauliflower broccoli and carrots (sometimes I might use a little butter to cook the mushrooms and onions while steaming the other veggies). I put a splash of siracha sauce on my plate for a little kick. I love it with cheese, but sometimes opt out just to save a few calories. Sometimes this meal is enough to last me until dinner time along with a fruit snack during the day. I love the high fiber vegetables in this because it really bulks up the meal and fills you up on very little extra calories. So this is my guilt-free breakfast go to meal. I could turn it into breakfast burritos, but if I'm going to go for a carb, I would rather have a breakfast potato."
2266426,377759,2018-10-25,0,"I tweaked my a lot. I chopped some homemade leftover cabbage &amp; veggie kimchi, leftover red onion, leftover, cooked, shredded pork, dry chives. For wet stuff I used less liquid, about 2 cups tomato-chicken boullion (but may try more liquid or more kimchi liquid) mixed with some extra korean red pepper flakes. I served then with whole milk Greek yogurt mixed with chili garlic sauce. They were awesome! Thanks for the inspiration!"
2001737055,97486,2018-10-25,4,I have made this for years... 35 to be exact... and I use graham cracker crust and lime jello. (not low fat / carb) It always turns out great! I prefer this as a summer dessert since it is so 'light'.
517816,115849,2018-10-24,5,I live in high altitude I went by the recipe exactly baked for 17 minutes and they turned out perfect!
2002310788,346640,2018-10-24,0,Tomor
2002310302,434863,2018-10-24,5,Delicious! I used turkey sausage (0 carbs) instead of ground beef. When I plugged the ingredients into Carb Manager it came out to 8 net carbs per serving (4 servings total).
2002310430,249284,2018-10-24,5,"Thank you, thank you! This was my favorite thing to order at Island's before they all closed down in the Phoenix area. I actually purchased kidney beans tonight so that I could make them as I was craving them. I searched for copycat recipe to make sure I remembered all the ingredients as found yours. Looks like I need to get ranch dressing and avocado. Thanks so much for the recipe!"
425105,363150,2018-10-24,5,"I was really excited to make this recipe, and it was just as good as I expected. I made it as a main dish with cornbread, and it was a great dinner. I actually think mixing in some cooked ground beef would be good too, but stuck to the recipe this time. I did use tomato basil soup instead of bisque, but I think they are pretty similar. I also used a little less cheddar than the recipe, and did garlic powder and some salt since I don't have garlic salt. It reminded me more of spaghettios than mac &amp; cheese in flavor. I think this would be great with homemade butternut or tomato basil soup too!"
169430,472488,2018-10-24,5,"I love fish and have it often -average 4 times a week- so was delighted to make this recipe as it is a new twist for me with this sauce which I will certainly use again with other fish, yum! No beets available so I used carrots and sliced Brussels sprouts which worked very well. Went with smoked salt and a fairly good grind of pepper. So simple to put together! and a real treat. Thanks for this keeper LIG."
2002310874,213565,2018-10-24,5,"Great recipe especially if you love puff pastry and do not want to deal with pie crust. I cook chicken thighs and use those as the meat. Dark meat has more flavor. I use 6-7 thighs pulled apart skin and bone removed. Carrots and peas are great I also chop and blanch one large potato and add. I increase the chicken broth to 2 cups and use 1/3 cup flour for my roux. I used heavy cream this time instead of milk becasue it was all I had and it worked great. Made the dish rich and very creamy. I also use a liberal amount of thyme and rosemary with some sage. These are the best poultry seasonings. I also recommend using two sheets of puff pastry they will overlap in the middle but that is fine. For the puff pastry I just followed the directions on the box and they came out perfect. This is am amzing dish and the kids love it. This feeds my family of 4, two teenagers and 2 adults. There’s sometimes one serving left over."
2002311046,58901,2018-10-24,0,"I fixed this soup last nite for dinner for the worlds 2 pickiest grand children, 8 and 9, and it went over very well. One didn't like the tomatoes, but loved the potatoes, additional veggies and meat, and the other loved it all. I did a few adjustments on the veggies. I added broccoli, green beans, left out the peas, and added cauliflower. It turned out much better than I thought and the adults loved it and want it again. So, thank you, I appreciate you sharing. Cheryl"
407619,200364,2018-10-24,5,Fantastic. Used raspberry peach G.M. Turned out moist. Loved the glaze. Sprinkled with poultry seasoning. Will make again for sure!

2002309792,427912,2018-10-24,2,"Way to much stuffing in this recipe. Using 1/2 of it recommended, they should call it stuffing casserole. This was a fail for our family."
2002311099,147910,2018-10-24,5,My cookies came too buttery. Anybody experienced the Same problem? I was just going to use less butter next time. Or what did I do wrong? Thank you
2002214643,332513,2018-10-24,5,"These turned out great. Adjustments: Used wheat flour. That means the cookies have a more rustic look. Terrific taste. Also used a pure cane sugar that was not white granulated. Last, using convection bake in the gas oven, at 13 minutes the cookies were done. I did glaze them. Will make more at Thanksgiving"
2002296945,92871,2018-10-24,4,"Only thing I did differently was add onion and other seasonings to my ground beef while cooking (garlic powder, salt, pepper). It was very good served with steamed sweet peas!"

2002311052,399373,2018-10-24,5,"It was delicious! I made a batch to split in to portion sizes to take for lunch at work over the week. I topped it with a dollop of sour cream and fresh cilantro (even though I added some as it was cooking). It made three lunch sized servings, and I would guess it cost me about $2 a serving, so a great economical and tasty option for lunch."
2002310792,36847,2018-10-24,4,"4 stars because I tweaked it a bit, but that's just for our taste. So, I made this today so we could have it for dinner tonight. Chili is almost always better if it has a while to stew before you eat it (at least I think so). It's on the stove now and my sneak-tastes have me so excited for this! It's just begging for some sour cream on top. Perfect for this gray day."

2002310455,234531,2018-10-24,5,"Made exactly to the recipe, except I added 1/4 cup fresh minced garlic (for garlic lovers) and 1 teaspoon dried crushed rosemary. I used the full 4 cups of flour, plus extra for rolling. Dough yielded 15 balls in a large rectangular Pyrex glass dish. I had time for the dough to rise extra and so after 4 hours they were nice and three times their size. Baked it directly for 15 min, rotating halfway through. Absolutely phenomenal and really fluffy!"

2002310719,409186,2018-10-24,5,This is the same recipe in Woman’s World Oct 29th magazine with Dr Stork (The Doctors) for losing weight. Eat as much of it as you like. It wasn’t done in the crockpot so l’m glad I found your recipe and some of the additions in the comment section! All he said was top each serving with Parmesan cheese. (Metabolic-revvving protein)

2002309566,250495,2018-10-23,5,I was looking for something simple with stuff I always have and this fir the bill perfectly. I tweaked it by adding 2 cans of water (about 28 oz) and 2 cups of quinoa (dry) so that I could have it as a whole meal instead of as a side!
2002214643,27276,2018-10-23,5,I used a canned salmon from Whole Foods which is very good. Substituted Ikea's mustard and dill sauce for the mustard and salted to taste. Very good. Used in a sprouted whole grain wrap from Angelic baking.

2002309572,15286,2018-10-23,5,"This recipe was great, my first time and they came out perfect. I did opt for premade chili sauce because i was worried about buying chili and buying some that were too hot. This recipe works good with chicken too. I did have too cook them longer however."
2002309738,275886,2018-10-23,5,"I took this recipe as a base and added to it based on stuff I had at home, and the result was awesome!

Used basil from my garden and next time might try it with both the basil and parsley :) So delicious and great flavor (especially from the nutmeg). A great vegetarian meal!!"
2002309441,297900,2018-10-23,1,Way under cooked. Don't follow these directions. Needs to be cooked longer
2002309723,486479,2018-10-23,0,"to get the texture of starbucks,( they are cooked in a vacuum seal bag ) you wold have to either buy a sous vide cooker ( how they are made) or could poach them in an egg poacher, and if you are an instata pot person, I think they have an insert to cook them, that is what makes them really good, only other thing is to try some 1/2&amp;1/2 instead of milk or cut down cheese ( will make them creamier like a quiche."
2000162245,186868,2018-10-23,5,Just made this ~ so easy and delicious! We went apple picking and lots of leftover apples that were going to go to waste. I halved the recipe for 8 cups of apples and it turned out perfect! Can't wait to bake them up over the holidays!
2002309909,62404,2018-10-23,0,can you stab a pork roast to let the brine get in deeper. its going to be shredded when it gets done cooking.
2002227190,526194,2018-10-23,1,I put a moose on top but it wouldn't fit in the oven.
2001465919,38298,2018-10-23,5,Soul food .... yum
2002253065,118242,2018-10-23,5,They were so good
1728376,153099,2018-10-23,5,"I made this recipe with pork chops as written and it was great. Tonight, I tried this recipe with chicken and peach jam and it was delicious. I did add about 1/2 cup water so there would be more sauce, but everything else was by the recipe. Thanks for sharing!"
2002309796,54257,2018-10-23,5,Best recipe ever!!
2269333,176261,2018-10-23,5,Best Recipe! Very Authentic german! Must keep for german-food lovers!!
2000498330,315732,2018-10-23,5,"This is a delicious, hearty, stick-to-your ribs meal. Easy, too. Served at a tailgate party and it was the IT dish. Everyone wanted the recipe. Very happy."
2002310233,101500,2018-10-23,5,Followed the recipe but only had Italian diced tomatoes with basil and oregano. Absolutely awesome. Served with garlic and butter texas toast croutons
2002309795,299433,2018-10-23,5,They were perfect! So happy to finally find a recipe that has good results and no flat cookies.
2002178264,259055,2018-10-23,5,"Great recipe! This might just be the best black bean soup I’ve ever made. I did make a few changes, based on my own preferences and what I had on hand: I halved the recipe, used two cans of black beans, added about a half cup of finely chopped bell pepper, used a couple of leftover pork chops, and did not add the milk. I also did not have a lime, so I used half an orange. We added plain Greek yogurt at the table to taste in lieu of sour cream. Served with garlic bread, this made a great meal."
2002310101,128956,2018-10-23,5,"I make this soup quite often - at least once a week. I add double the broth as well as a lot more cabbage than it calls for, and 2 cans of diced tomatoes. I do not add the carrots or green beans as I am not a big fan. I add at least triple the garlic as well as about a of half of a block of low fat cream cheese just to give it texture. I saute the onion and garlic and then saute the zucchini with it once the onion is finish. I let the soup simmer for 1 to 1.5 hours and as it is finishing, I add about half a teaspoon of cayenne to give it a kick. I added chicken to it once - that was the only time it went to waste :( This soup is delicious and a huge hit in our house!"
1803786474,105064,2018-10-23,5,"This recipe was wonderful . I used 1 tsp orange extract, no vanilla. Yum! It’s now October, still baking this on a regular basis."
2002101577,301754,2018-10-23,5,Made this for the first time today. Makes life so much easier with making this soup. My boyfriend and I have been wanting to have homemade potato soup but because I work in food service and he sleeps during the day we get lazy with dinners. Now I can prep this the night before and he can put this on when he gets home and it will be ready by dinner time. A little thin but will go with the recommendation of a roux next time and less onion possibly
2002310062,9506,2018-10-23,5,"I first made this casserole in high school home ec. Now I'm a grandmother and am visiting my son and family. I hadn't made this in awhile and needed my recipe which is at home. Thanks to you, I found it here! Looking forward to dinner!"
2002309547,506058,2018-10-23,5,Super simple and easy to makes! One of my childhood favorite dishes.
2002310009,30908,2018-10-23,5,"It's so good. Added a little mayo because didn't have enough sour cream for double batch. Peas, Mushrooms and Spinach. Crust on top looks fantastic. Can't wait for family to taste."
2002310067,99476,2018-10-23,3,I agree that we thought it was a little bland. Added in 1/4 cup of oyster sauce and a dash of red chili flakes to make it delicious!
1803787237,131607,2018-10-23,5,"Great recipe! Very easy to make, the dough turned out crunchy and light!"
719331,40760,2018-10-23,5,Fantastic recipe- just like my grandmother's version. This tastes terrific over Chocolate Devil's Food cake with creamy vanilla ice cream!
2002310216,358278,2018-10-23,0,"Hello and good day.! I tried your recipe and it went well, thank you. The only issue I've got is that this recipe is too sweet for me so I'd adjusted the sugar content from 35% to 15% , I'm new to cooking and I didn't know you need to stir it continuously while boiling because mine got burnt on the sides of the pan and it affects the taste of my cream. I converted mine into grams to get a measurement in small amount for a test run: Coconut milk - 500g = 100% milk powder - 165g = 33% i used fresh milk - 110g = 22% sugar - 75g = 15% corn starch - 25g = 5%"
2000838528,532078,2018-10-23,4,I usually am drawn to chicken with wine / Sherry not vinegar. But it was delicious!. I understood the roast potatoes because I make them all the time. But i cook them for about 50-60 min &amp; turn a free times. i poured some of the chicken fat into the pan potatoes. I might have given 5 stars but the recipe was a bit confusing. But it was delicious! Movie a regular in our house!
2002309444,60350,2018-10-23,5,"Oh.my.GOSH! This was so good! To do this recipe justice, I have some tips for those whose sauce came out gritty. Please do not overfill your 1/4 cup of flour .. loosely fill the cup to the top without packing it. Regarding adding the milk - add little by little, making sure the roux is fully mixed each time before adding more milk. I took my time making this, constantly whisking the roux from start to finish. I added paprika/garlic for more flavor and it was a good idea. I followed a tip mentioned here to remove from heat - it worked to make the cheese melt slowly so it won’t clump. One more thing - the sauce takes a long time to thicken and bubble if you do it right . It took me about 20-30 min to finish the roux. The sauce is so yummy and thick! I had the perfect amount of sauce for the amount of macaroni mentioned.. not sure how others made too much sauce? :/"
2002309932,464085,2018-10-23,5,"Added cinnamon chips throughout &amp; a layer of brown sugar/cinnamon/butter streusel, baked at 375 for 60 min. Honestly, it looked and felt like a brick when I took it out of the oven, but the reviews are fabulous!"
1530179,146036,2018-10-23,5,"I really enjoyed this fall recipe. Like others, I baked the squash 40 minutes, then the final 20 minutes with stuffing. I added carrots, but beyond that stuck to the recipe. My husband added sirracha ketchup because his taste buds are fried, but I thought it had a great sweet flavor as is. Great dish to mix up the regular routine in our house."
2002227190,234958,2018-10-23,3,Green Goddess must have tarragon and anchovies.
2002309862,528654,2018-10-23,5,"So, burnt fingers seems like a right of passage for this, but so worth it! Glad I came across these on Christine's Netflix series. First time working with caramel/sugar decorations and the more I made the easier it became. Time consuming, but worth it as well."
374891,37336,2018-10-23,5,I love this recipe! So easy to make and so melt in your mouth. Thanks!
2002309383,372133,2018-10-23,5,Thank you so much this was clear and easy :}
2002227190,296692,2018-10-23,4,Try it with sweet Marsala instead of the dry type for a very different but equally delish taste!
2002309688,2886,2018-10-23,5,"Hands down the best Banana bread ever! . My advice is to NOT change a thing in this recipe, it is perfectly delicious as is! I will be making a few loafs for the upcoming holidays. Also Don’t forget.... after the loaf of bread is room temperature, wrap It in foil and plastic wrap and freeze it. When ready to use, remove the foil and plastic wrap and cut the bread in slices (while still frozen) This keeps the bread from crumbling!"
2002310237,50592,2018-10-23,5,"Making it right now and the little taste I had was delicious! It has the perfect amount of sweetness and spice. I'm using old fashioned rolled oats (not quick oats), so I had to add more water to soften them. I also added a T of unsalted butter for creaminess. When I have it tomorrow morning, I will wake it up with some milk.??"
2002310118,434512,2018-10-23,0,Did you intend to add 1 whole onion and another 12 small onions?
2002310222,418658,2018-10-23,5,It was absolutely delicious!! I personally added another tsp is salt but we love it!!! Definitely saving this quick and yummy dinner for softball game nights!!!
2002236201,27208,2018-10-23,3,"It was good, but nothing outstanding about it. I made it without tweaks other than the addition of red wine. Not sure what everyone was going on about the saltiness or need to cut back on the dressing mixes... I followed the recipe &amp; didn’t find it to be salty at all - or overly flavorful for that matter. It was very tender, but it did cook for 9hrs in a crockpot ;) My wife likes her recipe better, so she’s going to make it later this week for comparison."
2002127430,137324,2018-10-23,5,"I have used ham, bacon and sausage in this recipe and each has worked well. I always use cheddar cheese (family favorite). I serve it with fried potatoes and toast."
2002309584,129192,2018-10-23,0,"At first i was skeptical, believing that it was to good to be true. However, with as few ingredients as it has, it was shockingly good. To be honest, this was the first time i made the dish successfully. I only had a can of fruit filling on hand to use with it, so you all can imagine how excited i am to try this with applez. Thank you for a simple recipe with BIG flavor."
2002305701,531150,2018-10-23,0,How thick do you cut the potatoes? It has a question mark in the recipe.
74904,315948,2018-10-23,5,"Oh my seasoned cook, this was sooooo good, I think, it was better than Outbacks. My hubby never eats salad, and he ate this and commented that it was great. I followed directions except I candied the pecans with some brown sugar. I drizzled with We Olives Pineapple White Balsamic just before I added your outstanding blue cheese dressing. Update. I’m still making your salad and have used We Olives 100 year old balsamic instead of the pineapple and it also goes over so well. Thank you again."
886631,288988,2018-10-23,5,"So good! My husband doesn't like cauliflower, loved it."
2002310129,453185,2018-10-23,5,"This is the first recipe I ever made for my daughter, as she got older I stopped blending it. Also I freeze portion cups of these for on the go quick meals."
1711956,430350,2018-10-23,5,Thanks for the recipe. Very delicious by itself or my favorite is with a thin slice of cotija cheese and prosciutto. I'm new to bread and sourdough baking and have really good results when I use the recipes that start with a batter type sponge. I might use less strong coffee next time as I brew with a mocha pot.
2002309743,124253,2018-10-23,5,"This was really good. Not incredibly soupy, like many goulash recipes. I added some celery with the onion. Also some mushrooms. Also used the larger size can of stewed Italian tomatoes. Will definately make this often as it is economical and easy to put together."
2002310197,66409,2018-10-23,5,"These turned out so flaky and delicious despite just having a few ingredients. The only thing I did different, was add dried cherries, then topped with a milk wash and turbinado sugar. I will definitely be making these again. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!"
2002309811,101954,2018-10-23,5,"First off the 5 stars is for the actual recipe it self. Wasn't happy with the crust I purchased..Read on... Ive never had Pecan Pie but when I saw this recipe and the reviews I had to try it out. First off I think I over cooked it, the unbaked pillsbury pie crust almost seemed to thin for the filling. It made it through the crust (however the crust really thinned out during baking. Could just be the brand of crust. Any other suggestions?? It said to cook until &quot;Set&quot; wasn't sure what was considered &quot;set&quot; since this was my first time. I have a gas stove so I am sure it cooks a lot faster or maybe I need to cook at 300 degrees? other then the top being a little rough the pie was delicious ..my kids and I really enjoyed it. Thank you so much I will be making this for the holidays any suggestions on the cook time and the pie crust."
2002254889,146760,2018-10-23,4,"We add frozen vegetables to this before putting it in the oven, either corn or peas, it gives it another texture"
2002227190,476538,2018-10-23,4,"There are 2 kinds of Marsala, sweet, and dry. Both work well for this dish but have very different flavors. Both are excellent."
2103883,203284,2018-10-23,5,"These are awesome. I tried to tweek them to make a combo of Cowboy/Monster/fall cookies. I took out 1/4 cup brown sugar, added 1/2 cup of flour extra, 1 cup of pumpkin, 1 cup of homemade apple sauce, 1 1/2 cup toasted pecans, 1 cup of salted caramel chips, 1/2 cup dk choc chips and 1/2 white choc chips , 1 cup toasted coconut and finally 1 cup of currants. They are to die for! Used an ice cream scoop to make. 350 21 min."
2002309505,139499,2018-10-23,5,"I used Bob's gluten free flour mixture and they came out perfectly. With a few tweaks. And remember, never, ever overmix muffin batter!"
2002308604,241784,2018-10-22,5,Making this again. One of mine and my hubby's favorite Fall meals
2002309114,604,2018-10-22,0,I have the same problem with density. Am going to try with less flour
2002308488,482277,2018-10-22,5,"Truly yummy - used 3 fresh chicken breasts with bones (for flavor) - 1 jar salsa 1 pkg taco seasoning added 1/2 cup broth for more liquid at end of cooking- served with roasted peppers, onions. a definite crowd pleaser."
2002308444,472445,2018-10-22,5,"I added 1 T of brown sugar and 1/2t of liquid smoke after reading comments. Salt the beef chunks before browning. (It doesn’t say that in the instructions) and use some of the chicken broth to deglaze th saut&eacute; pan and add that to the crockpot. Next time I’ll do it in the pressure cooker. Great recipe, they got it right."
2002023101,258279,2018-10-22,5,"I don't need to cook this to tell you it is corn chowder the way it's supposed to be made. I have been making this recipe (without Worcestershire or bacon) for 40 years. Of course I don't do it in a slow cooker and I use fresh potatoes... If you make it on the stovetop, saute' the onions in a little butter and then add the potatoes and some broth/water and cook until tender. Add the other ingredients and get it warmed up. Be sure to make it one day in advance so the soup thickens up nicely."
2001362355,474360,2018-10-22,5,Easy to work with and had enough for one large and one small pie. Didn't need all the ice water.
2001463140,141983,2018-10-22,0,I added Shrimp Delicious!
2442925,471867,2018-10-22,5,"Loved these little sandwiches! They were great for a neighborhood get together. Put together earlier in the day and heated 1/2 hour before leaving. I used 17 dinner rolls, slightly larger then a party roll, and they were excellent. No leftovers to take home! I only used mayonnaise as I didn't have Miracle Whip in the house. I will try M.W. next time I make them but they were very good with just mayo. And I love how easy they are to make! Thanks Michelle for sharing this really good recipe !"
2002308991,219409,2018-10-22,5,really good recipe I had some leftover chicken fajita and this will be perfect for a dressing.
2002308912,89139,2018-10-22,0,I have used this recipe several times and it turned out great My family loves it...they should have never let Paula go.. all of her recipes are fantastic!
2002308439,395966,2018-10-22,5,"This is a fantastic recipe! I made it for the first time last week and haven’t been able to keep a loaf in the house. I first made it with the amount of caraway seeds listed, but then doubled it every time after because we like seeds."
1630909,54257,2018-10-22,0,Geez! did your Ego make it too salty or what??
34122,388577,2018-10-22,5,Really good and really easy. This is great for an autumn dessert. My granola was stale and I didn’t feel like going back to the store so I didn’t add a topping. We served it warm with vanilla ice cream. I plan to make it for one of our thanksgiving desserts. Thanks Elaine!
1802936715,95312,2018-10-22,5,"Turned out great, will make again! However my husband added lemon pepper to rice and it was a bit too spicy for me."
2001586947,2886,2018-10-22,5,Great banana bread recipe! Thanks for sharing!
2002303398,108231,2018-10-22,4,"Great soup, just seemed to be lacking a bit of depth. Will try simmering for longer than the recipe says next time."
2002303398,302120,2018-10-22,5,English boyfriend went nuts over the cottage pie version of this... enough said.
2002309207,98652,2018-10-22,5,"These are bomb! I've been trying to bake more but im not used to using my hands for recipes because I mostly bake banana bread and cakes/cupcakes/muffins, but this is awesome!"
2000014528,173518,2018-10-22,5,"Loved this cake! moist,"
2002308474,84324,2018-10-22,4,Being an Indian and having eaten this dish gazzilion times I'd like to recommend; -adding cumin seeds before onions because the seeds are supposed to pop in oil -adding garam masala before you start to cook veggies as it is supposed to mix with everything and give out an even better flavour. Enjoy!
2002309029,388830,2018-10-22,5,"This salsa turned out very well. All the comments were very helpful. I did forget to use my canning salt so I hope that the salsa does not discolor too much, as I have read that on other cooking sites."
2002302697,74769,2018-10-22,5,"Thank you Ranikabani for the nice curry recipe ! Turned out quick and tasty ! The technique for the curry is excellent, and one can adjust spices as required. Thank you !"
2002038311,536845,2018-10-22,0,What do you do with the olive oil?
2001906623,41992,2018-10-22,5,"So yummy! I used fully cooked shrimp instead of raw &amp; I added some chopped red onion with the garlic. I skipped the red pepper flakes but added some fresh ground pepper. I added the shrimp to the pan, heated about 1 minute then added wine &amp; cooked 1 more min while turning the shrimp. I followed the rest of the recipe &amp; topped the dish off with crisp steamed fresh broccoli &amp; served over spaghetti. A little Italian bread to mop up the sauce made this all so Delish!"
198981,275675,2018-10-22,5,This was DELICIOUS!!! Very simple to make. Thank you for sharing. Definitely a keeper!
2002308958,175605,2018-10-22,0,I made it then try it they wondered why is it so salty the checked the recipe and realised I did 1/4 cup of salt not teaspoon
2002309069,112211,2018-10-22,5,The flavor of the pie was fabulous and I have made this pie several times it is my husbands favorite. I make my own graham cracker crust for it instead of the traditional pie crust. My question is this time when I made it my filling didn’t set up I tried it with 2 full eggs and also with 4 egg yolks neither way set up right what did I do wrong?
2002309004,472251,2018-10-22,5,This is exactly the way my grandmother and mother made tongue ?? Couldn’t find any other recipe on my regular food apps. Good work Tongue is the best
2002308600,100727,2018-10-22,1,The mix turned out too wet. Had to add a lot of flour and ended with the cookies being hard and tasting burnt.
200339,19047,2018-10-22,5,"Great recipe! When making the dumplings, always cook them 10 minutes with the cover off, then 10 minutes with the cover on. Mine come out nice and fluffy."
1686076,19938,2018-10-22,4,"my problem here was there weren't enough beans!! I'm sure that was my fault-the size of my soup pot was too large. However the broth was flavorful and we could definitely taste the potential here. Stupid mistake aside, I would use this recipe again."
2002308571,302697,2018-10-22,0,"I'm American. Can you explain this direction &quot;1?2 pint milk, and water, mixed and warmed to blood heat (more if necessary&quot;? Is this 1/2 pint milk with water added and how much liquid total? I believe that &quot;blood heat&quot; would be 98.6 degrees. Is this correct?"
1732579,34931,2018-10-22,4,Its a good basic recipe . Followed vrvrvr's advice and made my own tweaks . Reduced flour to 1/2 cup . Reduced baking powder to 1 teaspoon . Then added 1/2 tablespoon of KFC's 11 herbs n spices to the chicken mix . Dipping sauce was a nice addition but not necessary for this . Very tasty ! Great potential . Thank you OceanIvy !!!
2002305562,134621,2018-10-22,0,"I made the chicken and dumplings.they are wonderful. With 6 cups flour,it makes alot.when I make again I,m going to half the dumpling recipe.but,I or half in a plastic bag in the fridge and made another recipe of the chicken the next day,and the dough was so much easier to work with,from now on I will always chill the dough.We all loved it,I am taking it to a potluck soon."
2000719148,530231,2018-10-22,0,What are the dry ingredients??
2002308543,444589,2018-10-22,0,Chicken turned out amazing. But the tip of rinsing the chicken is a disaster waiting to happen. Please dont. You can make your family very sick as splatter from rinsing can contaminate your kitchen.
2002308541,135870,2018-10-22,5,I got progressively better results but the biggest change for me was to increase the baking temperature to 400 to 425 degrees from 350. Kept the recipe pretty well intact
2001304205,253577,2018-10-22,1,FOUR HOURS?? NO clay pot recipe takes that long! This should really only take about an hour and half MAX.
2002308577,191859,2018-10-22,5,"This was fantastic! I substituted organic almond milk in place of the milk and didn't add the flour (only b/c I forgot -oops!) - and kind of added a little more on the spices I might have used a full teaspoon on the ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon but kept the allspice proportional to the recipe. I also forgot to add vanilla b/c we didn't have any - but it tastes great! :) It reminds me of Thank"
2002309238,279082,2018-10-22,3,Lacked flavour. Needs garlic for a start plus a whole lot more herbs.
656836,383365,2018-10-22,4,"The recipe from Bon Appetit, as published 36 years ago, is a bit different, in that the recipe is the same as posted above, except the original called for: 1 and 1/4 pounds of ricotta, and only 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. The oven temperature is 350 degrees."
2002308206,451250,2018-10-22,0,"I'm going to make these later this week, I think that this is the recipe my mom used when we were kids. She used to make them for my father's restaurants to sell, and they always sold out every day. :-)"
280271,274468,2018-10-22,5,We loved this...I used the fancy whole baby clams by Bumble Bee...this gave us big chunks in every bite...I also cut this way back to serve 2...it does need salt...made for &quot;Autumn Fever&quot; tag game...
2002063286,150384,2018-10-22,5,"I love this recipe! I add a bit more broccoli, about double the cheese and some garlic powder."
2002241688,286288,2018-10-22,3,I made this last night. The recipe wasn't clear on how the pasta should be cooked and since I like my noodle al dente I prepared them that was. I thought overall it was okay. I may make this again tweaking certain things here and there to see if I like it more.
2002307966,107868,2018-10-22,5,"Easy breezy. I used to make bread for my family 40 years ago - 8 loaves a week on Monday. First loaf got eaten immediately- haha - and then we had a loaf a day until the next Monday. A LOT of work. I have missed the flavor of my bread, especially as my morning toast. And then came this recipe- and the wonderful bread machine invention and I have my bread back. It’s only my husband and I so one loaf lasts a few days but it’s so easy, multiple loaves are no problem. LOVE this recipe."
2002308744,350745,2018-10-22,5,"Super easy recipe tweaked a little, added carrots after the first hour of cooking. Looking forward to it tasting even better the next day."
2002308560,75453,2018-10-22,2,"I dont enjoy making bad reviews so im sorry.. Simple to make, i just was not a fan of how they turned out. Wasnt the right taste for me"
239758,502881,2018-10-22,5,"I wanted to serve this today with a slow-cooked beef casserole, so used the orange sweet potatoes I already had on hand. Besides, white sweet potatoes aren’t all that common in Australia. It was for just two of us, so I used 2 medium-sized sweet potatoes, 5 cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 1/2 tablespoons of whipping cream. Hubby said, ‘This is so good, what’s that extra added flavour?’ and I knew he meant the roasted garlic. A truly delicious way to make sweet potatoes. Will make often."
2002253032,194692,2018-10-22,5,Easy and delicious
1031825,251762,2018-10-22,5,"This is my son’s favorite Halloween dish and really his favorite wings, period! Very sticky and messy, but it wouldn’t be as much fun otherwise! I skimp on the hot sauce and just use black food coloring."
2002309005,24712,2018-10-22,5,"I discovered Greek soup just recently. There are not too many Greek restaurants around here that serve this wonderful soup. Then I came across this recipe! I was completely blown away. It is absolutely delicious, and so easy to make. I did add chicken concentrate in lieu of the bouillon Cube. This gave a lot more chicken flavor. I am sure a bouillon Cube would be fine, but I did add that little extra touch. I didn't have carrots in my house, but I did not want to leave them out. I did have a bag of mixed vegetables and managed 2 easily get one third of a cup. Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe. My husband, who is very picky loves it. I made a batch last week and intend to make another one today."
59284,325185,2018-10-22,0,This is my favorite comfort food recipe that I make each year for Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas -- I use a generous amount of grated muenster cheese on top vs. gruyere. Delicious!
2002307381,205890,2018-10-21,5,These are so good!!! Sprinkled kosher salt on top omg so good!!!!
2002308018,140915,2018-10-21,5,"I lightly browned the chicken in a frying pan first, because I find the ghostly white pallor of white meat cooked in a crock pot slightly off-putting."
2000892857,56396,2018-10-21,5,"I used butter instead of margarine and sauteed the onion in butter before making the sauce. I used 1/2 &amp; 1/2 instead of milk in the sauce ans warmed the peas in hot water before mixing them in. I added salt &amp; pepper and served over mashed potatoes. I will also try serving this over rice, pasta or toast. Yummy. I have been looking for this recipe for years. My husband's mother made it when he was a kid, but I couldn't find it in her old cookbook or recipes. It must have been a recipe in her head!"
239758,258549,2018-10-21,5,"We are big fans of sweet potatoes and this recipe does them proud. Chipotle powder and sauce are hard (or impossible) to get in Australia, so I used smoked paprika (recommended online as a good substitute). Lime is the perfect addition to this recipe. I will make this often. Thanks so much for posting."
2002307633,203062,2018-10-21,5,"I make these doughnuts all the time and they always turn out great. I let them rise a little more than 30min in the oven with the light on. I usually have to add extra flour so they don’t stick to the parchment paper I rise them on, but too much flour makes them flat and heavy. I roll them in cinnamon sugar right out of the oil and they disappear in no time!"
250812,50144,2018-10-21,5,"I have made this many times, and can't believe i haven't reviewed it yet. I love that for ten minutes of work, i have a great soup at the end of the day. I love the flavor. Sometimes if i've cut the potato too big, I go in with a masher real quick. Another tip is to cube the cream cheese, plop it in and wait about 30 minutes before mixing. Thank You for a great recipe. For those that think this soup is too thin, your potato matters. If you use russet, 8cups is plenty, if you use golden, you need 2-3 more cups."
2002307420,96091,2018-10-21,0,this is orange juice
2002308416,140507,2018-10-21,0,Absolutely delicious! I have been cooking with venison for 25+ years. This was excellent!
2001444411,225416,2018-10-21,0,Has anyone made this the night before and baked it in the morning?
2001625264,486641,2018-10-21,5,Very good.
2002308158,2886,2018-10-21,5,"came out perfect, I left out the vanilla since the price has skyrocketed here, and it was better...all nice banana flavor. I sprayed the pan with Pam."
2002307456,454943,2018-10-21,0,If you want a middle eastern twist cook it with a quarter teaspoon of ground saffron(Persian saffron that is red in color is best). Then add a quarter cup Rosewater and garnish with cinnamon.
2002308168,454978,2018-10-21,5,"The top comments mentions the icing being dark and gritty. I believe this person applied the icing before cooking, for which this wasn't intended. Applied to cinnamon rolls that just came out of the oven, it's smooth, slightly sticky, and beautiful like the pictures. Perfect"
2002308152,37413,2018-10-21,5,Absolutely yummy!!!
2002307309,118242,2018-10-21,5,"Perfection! My super picky eater nephew gobbled these up and wanted more when I visit again, which astonished me, and the entire dish was gone in minutes. Everyone, including myself, went crazy on these brownies. So glad I finally found the recipe I'd been looking for!"
239758,513440,2018-10-21,5,"Oh my goodness, what a delicious recipe for chicken. A little while ago, a friend gave me a jar of gourmet chile jam that, in my opinion, wasn't all that interesting. I chose this recipe to see if it might be the perfect way to use up this jam. Well. I was right. I used a couple of boneless chicken breasts, and they were perfect. You can be sure this jar of chile jam will be gone in no time. Served with sweet potatoes and wild rice."
2001902637,137575,2018-10-21,0,I leave mine in.
2001495013,205277,2018-10-21,0,1/3 cup of lemon juice is way to much.
2002307715,187362,2018-10-21,5,"These really are the perfect pancakes. They are light, fluffy, and healthy with low sugar and the addition of pumpkin. Use buttermilk (or sour regular milk with 1 Tablespoon vinegar), and you'll get a higher rise and softer cake."
266635,359321,2018-10-21,5,What a great dessert and one that will be great for the holidays. You can substitute any frozen berries as well. I made just as directed and we loved the tartness of the raspberry jello topping and the sweetness of the cream cheese layer. Easy to make and it makes a wonderful presentation.
2002308126,276355,2018-10-21,5,This recipe was easy to make and it came out delicious !!!
2002308231,293243,2018-10-21,5,"SO GOOD!!!!!! I found that the icing was a little bit sweet, so next time I will probably half the amount and add some vanilla. I also ended up softening some butter and adding that to the icing, and it gave it a wonderfully creamy taste. Other than that, really nice job!"
2002301119,351755,2018-10-21,0,"ok so didn't try it, but being from Louisiana we always begin meatloaf with the Cajun Trinity....but I wanted to add this was something that my hubby talked me into a few years ago....Topping the meatloaf with bbq sauce. I don't like full on bbq sauce, but if you don't try half an half or more or less ketchup/bbq sauce. Bbq sauce lends a delicious flavor and slight sweetness to meatloaf. Or, form mini meatloafs, or slice your meatloaf after cooking....chill it out in fridge or freezer and serve cold meatloaf sandwiches for dinner, yummo!!"
2002307523,160393,2018-10-21,4,As I begin to write this it is sitting in the oven and I'm a little peeved. I won't post until we taste it. The top of the recipe clearly said &quot;Finished in 45 minutes.&quot; However the instructions call for a baking time of 1 hour and a cooling period of 30 minutes. This does not include prep. So this is not a 45 minute recipe but a 1 hour and 45 minute recipe. Why does Genius Kitchen and other similar sites insist in publishing these false times?? Now the review of the recipe. Very good. A little too sweet for my tastes but quite tasty.
280271,305248,2018-10-21,5,My German hubby loved this...even if it's not made with veal or pork...and he's not a chicken lover...the mushroom sauce was delicious...I used heavy cream instead of sour cream...this is a keeper and will be made again...made for FYC tag game...
2002308409,99476,2018-10-21,5,Great! Made it tonight - so easy and my husband rated it a 5*.
2002307795,93886,2018-10-21,5,
2002292250,536474,2018-10-21,4,It was fantastic! We'll definitely make it again.
2002308266,44278,2018-10-21,5,"Have it in the Dutch oven right now ,used EVOO ,2 cloves of fresh garlic,black pepper and rubbed with 1/2 pack of onion soup mix ,braised on all sides ,then put chopped carrots ,1 small fresh onion ,3 short stalks of celery ,7 small red potatoes ,the rest of Onion sup mix 1 cup water and a 8 oz can of diced unsalted tomatoes covered cooking at 350 degrees for 1hr 20min ,looks and smells rocking !!!!"
227831,89204,2018-10-21,5,I needed comfort food from a crock pot. I used one one chicken breast for just DH and I. And I shredded it at the end and served it over rice. I also added sliced onions and green peppers. I also added about 1 tsp of cumin because I like cumin and black beans.
2002307691,533699,2018-10-21,5,Made these last year for Halloween and they were a hit! Making them again this year!
2002307467,423823,2018-10-21,0,EXCELLENT! Am very pleased with the ease and taste of the German pork roast. It would be helpful to have the nutritional data.
2002307950,34103,2018-10-21,5,"Great recipe! I wanted a healthier version of Swedish meatballs for my husband. He loved it and said it tastes just as good as the meat ones. I used 1 medium finely chopped onion instead on onion flakes, and juice of one lemon instead of lemon pepper seasoning."
2002308352,44115,2018-10-21,5,"Super easy, super delicious! Thanks for sharing."
2002308029,35393,2018-10-21,3,Although they were quick and easy to mix up they took about 31 minutes to bake. They taste good in the end!
2001571166,211006,2018-10-21,5,I'm NOT a big fan of potatoes but these certainly made me a believer that potatoes can be so much...more!
2001688000,67256,2018-10-21,0,"I tried this recipe for the first time a couple of weeks ago. I halved the recipe in case we didn't like it. BIG MISTAKE! This was one of the best cakes I have ever made! (Or tasted!) I have just made it again for the third time. My son had requested it for his Birthday. Definitely a KEEPER! I did make 2 tweets. I added 1/2 cup toasted , chopped walnuts to the batter and swapped the buttermilk for sour cream. DELISH!!! Thanks Rhonda"
2002233624,38298,2018-10-21,0,This is a very flavourful soup.
1860800,63071,2018-10-21,5,The best! I just replaced the vegetable oil for butter.
400708,423603,2018-10-21,5,"Served to friends visiting and WOW, what a hit, loved the similar to a Mimosa but with that extra kick. We'll be doing this one again for sure. Thanks for posting"
2002219965,96523,2018-10-21,3,Dough was very crumbly so added another egg to improve the batter. Were still raw inside after baking so returned to oven for longer baking time. Taste was pretty good. Felt like the recipe was a little incomplete
2000715951,491771,2018-10-21,5,"This recipe is stolen from Canadian Check Michael Smith. It's the recipe my family has used for over a decade and a half and it's excellent. Wish credit was given where credit was due, though."
2594711,171703,2018-10-21,5,I gave the recipe to my son and told him not to make any changes. He did exactly that and had enough candy to make 3 medium/large honey crisp apples and 4 small granny Smith apples. We will be using the recipe again because it was very easy and the apples were delicious! I was looking for a recipe that did not use corn syrup and this is definitely it! Thanks for sharing!!
2000497507,187734,2018-10-21,0,"I just want to know if using Canadian butter, with less fat content I have been told, would make a difference in making this pastry."
2002307380,58901,2018-10-21,5,This recipe has become a favorite of mine and others in my house. I have made over 10x in crock pot (slow cooker on high for 4-6hours then on low for another few) and tweaked a little. The best it ever tasted is when I added a small pinch of Thyme and 1 cup chicken broth.
2001609576,334483,2018-10-21,5,"Made a whole pile of vegetables and this recipe was very good! I did take the tip of people &amp; added the water based veggies (broccoli, mushrooms, and squash) toward the end of cooking. You could also use leftovers with cooked pasta or put in a soup! This is a keeper!"
239758,373346,2018-10-21,5,"There were just three of us today, so I made 1/3 of a batch. Made mostly as written, using chives from my garden and low-fat milk. Creme fraiche isn’t readily available in Australia, so I used sour cream instead. At first I thought there would be too much liquid, but the quantities were spot on. The guest who joined us for the meal was still enjoying spoonfuls of potatoes as she went out the door to go home. Served with sumac chicken, mushroom casserole and honeyed carrots. Thanks for this brilliant recipe."
2002308155,366948,2018-10-21,5,Very tender and good flavor. Juicy. I added 1/2c beef bullion
2002307326,375567,2018-10-21,3,I used one half cup less of the sugar and used three quarters cup of especially dark cocoa powder. I wouldn't use this recipe either. not my favorite .
2002308118,338034,2018-10-21,5,"This recipe is amazing. I used bread flour and butter, so it didn’t come out exactly the way I think Cuban bread should be, but I think with lard it would be more true to the Cuban bread I grew up eating. Honestly the BEST bread recipe I’ve used, hands down. My family adores it. THANK YOU!!!"
2002275307,27208,2018-10-21,5,"Followed the recipe, and it was the best roast ever. I served it to four fiends, and they all wanted the recipe. We made sandwiches two days later and had the same results, best flavor for a sandwich from a pot roast ever."
2001001984,377636,2018-10-21,5,"Quick, easy and delicious. The recipe is also very adaptable. I cut down the agave and added some peanut butter and it worked perfectly as well. I've made other recipes from Elana's Pantry as well and have never been disappointed."
2040168,261889,2018-10-21,5,"Best sugar cookie recipe, and I’ve tried quite a few. I debated doing a royal icing with it instead but this frosting complements the cookie so we’ll, I opted not to mess with it. This is definitely my go to sugar cookie recipe from now on!"
226863,353209,2018-10-21,5,Nice vegetable soup with some italian flavor. Low carb and low fat.....I wanted to add ditalini and italian sausage but stuck true to the recipe. Plan on taking this for my lunch during the work week this week. Thanks for sharing! Made for your win in Football tag.
2002307457,153642,2018-10-21,5,"Perfect recipe, loved the shape and texture of these muffins - crusty top with light and noisy centre - I used frozen blueberries and Self raising flour (no baking powder or soda)."
2001906623,155575,2018-10-21,5,These were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written &amp; the muffins were a hit! I covered leftovers with plastic which made the tops sticky (but still yummy) on day 2.
2002307671,457630,2018-10-21,4,"The only reason for giving this a four, the fruit filling was slighly runny. Taste deserves a five plus stars!"
2001827999,498441,2018-10-21,0,What kind of beef - i.e. how much fat? I can't wait to try.
2001562234,384519,2018-10-21,0,2349 calories? Are y'all out of your minds? That's more than I eat in an entire day!
2002308131,11345,2018-10-21,5,GREAT AND EASY
2002302697,250903,2018-10-21,5,"Yes, this recipe turned out great ! Great taste and easy to make. Good for the kids !"
2002308335,266248,2018-10-21,5,I first made this recipe in 2007 and love it! Doesn't make as many as the recipe stated so I usually double it. Easy to do---especially when you don't make the filling. I use store bought Dickenson's lemon curd....almost exactly the same ingredients...no cornstarch as it doesn't need it. We couldn't tell the difference.
2002002529,424498,2018-10-21,0,I made this for my brothers with prime rub. I was amazed that I could do it. Absolutely amazing.
2002198722,181954,2018-10-20,5,"This was a really good lower fat gumbo. The dry roux is such a great idea. I did it in a 400-degree oven so I didn't have to put in any effort at all. I had a few shrimp I threw in at the end just because they were there. :) Oh, and I used grilled chicken breasts that I shredded because that is what I had already cooked. Really really good with a fraction of the fat, yet all the flavor one could ask for! It only took a decade to get a review; I hope it was worth the wait, lol.. :) Thanks for sharing!"
2002307130,108231,2018-10-20,4,"First time ever trying tortilla soup, it was really good. However, I'd recommend deviating from the recipe, don't use frozen corn, use fresh. We're not animals. Cut the kernels off the ear and grill them for a couple of minutes to bring out their flavour. Also, regarding the chicken, throw it into the pot after you've sauteed the onion etc, for a couple of minutes. Holding off on adding the other ingredients, in order to get a slight sear on the meat before you blanch it in all that liquid."
2002306355,109264,2018-10-20,5,Turned out EXCELLENT!! My kids and Sister had bought some frozen ones earlier today... EVERYONE said mine was BETTER??!
2002295999,91827,2018-10-20,0,"Oh my gosh, thank you. Haven’t had Pizza Hut pan pizza for years due to having to eat gluten free or organic flour. Had to make myself stop eating this. Forgot to add the oil before the flour, so kneaded the oil in. It worked just fine. Also I used regular milk. Added it to the water and heated it together. Perfect recipe!"
2002306798,204512,2018-10-20,5,Delicious! I think I squeezed the lemon too much tho. It came out with a fairly lemony taste. We'll see how it tastes after it's chilled.
2001362355,75453,2018-10-20,5,I only used 1 teaspoon of salt and only baked 1 hour and 30 minutes. I had dried my seeds overnight so maybe that's why they didn't need 2 hours. Great flavor and so easy to make!
2000860245,74512,2018-10-20,5,Made this years ago for my boys’ Halloween Party. It looked grossly real but tasted good. It’s easy to make. Also made booger’s on a stick just put green food coloring in Cheez Wiz and dip pretzel sticks in it (very gross)
1802936715,246693,2018-10-20,4,"It was good, but not much flavor. I did not add as much &quot;heat&quot; to it as stated in recipe as not everyone likes that here. I let those who like &quot;heat&quot; add what they wanted. However, I will make it again adding more and possibly different seasoning."
1060667,141983,2018-10-20,5,"I have to say, this is pretty amazing! My whole family was gobbling it up, husband went back for seconds. Very easy too! Served mine over futtucini, not angel hair and topped with grilled chicken, yum!!"
2002307099,12199,2018-10-20,4,Do not bake this is an 8 by 8 dish...use a 9 by 13
2000568376,302120,2018-10-20,0,"Just horrible. Made with hamburger, and no diversion from the recipe. I added cheddar cheese to the mashed and topped it with fresh, toasted bread crumbs. Even my daughter didn't like it. Sorry, but I guess you win some and lose some."
2001363566,9054,2018-10-20,5,"I know from past experience that big potato pancakes just don't work, so I made these about half the size (in about 1/8 inch hot-ish oil, 3 min per side) and they were great. Small enough that there wasn't so much weight and crisp enough that the shell sort of contained the moosh."
2002306309,316629,2018-10-20,0,"I think the opinions may be varied on this. I also personally disagree. From another site, &quot;Soaking beans in salted water helps them cook up more tender.&quot;"
2002307199,476961,2018-10-20,5,I love this easy casserole!
2001770476,14031,2018-10-20,3,That's a lot of cilantro. Next time I'm going to use 1/2 of that. I also agree with adding salsa. I added 2 table spoons of that.
614398,282040,2018-10-20,5,Can I make this chocolate flavored? How much cocoa?
2002307069,199579,2018-10-20,5,"Great recipe! First time making tuna casserole and I have to admit that it was better than Mom’s. I did tweak a bit...use two cans on tuna, cream of mushroom verses cream of chicken, I added one cup of sour cream, 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/4 cup of crackers or panko, one 2/3 cup of peas and Saut&eacute;ed the celery and onions. Making second batch for the day as the family ate it all within an hour. Their only ask was to add buttered bread crumbs on top... it’s a family thing."
2002306660,463894,2018-10-20,5,"I left the seeds in and the skin on, and used a little less sugar. It turned out great! I don't notice the seeds at all."
2460712,88812,2018-10-20,0,"It is not recommended to substitute confectioners sugar for granulated sugar. Since confectioners sugar has a much finer texture, and it contains a small percentage of cornstarch to prevent caking, substituting can give you unexpected results."
2002306551,123111,2018-10-20,5,yum!
2002157583,7359,2018-10-20,5,"This was a winner, easy and delicious. My partner who usually doesn't like fish thought it was &quot;really good&quot;. I didn't have corn meal so I used matzah meal instead and dusted the fish with salt, pepper and some garlic powder. Three table spoons of butter was a bit too much so cut back to two. This will become a stable in our meals."
2001828355,427971,2018-10-20,5,"Great recipe! Chicken + Brine-prep + Grilling = AMAZING!!! In general, I have used your marinade recipe in many other types grilled chicken; from Chicken thighs to a whole Chicken!"
2002306416,382103,2018-10-20,4,"I HIGHLY recommend using Pineapple Sage flowers instead of Maraschino cherries. Fake cherries add a sickly sweetness to an already-sweet dish, whereas Pineapple Sage flowers add the same pop of color with an elevated flavor."
2002219295,38298,2018-10-20,5,Was amazing and I’m doing it again tonight! Thanks!!! Xoxoxo
2002183844,504310,2018-10-20,5,We loved it! Thanks so much!
2002306423,126920,2018-10-20,0,Nice easy recipe. This was my first time preparing rabbit so I wanted to start out with something a bit light - this recipe was the perfect choice. I let the meat marinate over night for about 24 hours and it was delicious. Very easy recipe to make and follow.
200339,227756,2018-10-20,2,"Family didn't care for the mayo taste, added extra garlic powder on top after the complaints, that helped a bit."
2002157583,41782,2018-10-20,4,"I love pumpkin and zucchini and had a load of bananas that needed to be used immediately, so this seemed like the perfect recipe. But, I only used half the sugar (we all need to cut down on refined sugar) and substituted grapeseed oil for the butter as another reviewer suggested and only used half a cup. I lined the pan with vegetable spray. The batter was super thick. Nowhere does it say what size loaf pans to use. I found that using a 4.5 by 8 was large enough for one loaf with enough batter left over for 5 muffins. I added nuts to the whole batter and then added raisins to the muffins as I was specifically making them for a little girl who loves raisins. All turned out really great although I'm not sure how long the bake time was because I just kept adding 10 minutes and then 5 minutes until the loaf seemed done."
400708,283050,2018-10-20,5,"OMG, everyone LOVED these pancakes, and I loved that it made just enough for our family of 3 and not a ton. So good with that rich coffee flavor. Mine turned out nice and fluffy, but did cook up rather dark, but thinking that's just from the ingredients as they tasted great and nothing better than chocolate chips and pecans to set off a pancake. I ate mine plan as didn't need any butter or syrup, DH topped his with both - but no matter the topping the pancakes themselves are over the top good. Made for Autumn Fever Game"
2002306783,49414,2018-10-20,1,"I must have done something wrong, but I sAw many other reviews said 10 minutes was not long enough as well- it definitely was not! I pounded the chicken breasts but it still took so long that everything on the inside tasted rubbery and gross, I had to put it in the oven for an extra 15. Use thin breasts, cut them, bake or sautee them a little bit first...something! Also I’m sure experienced cooks and intelligent people everywhere knew what to do with the onions, but after saut&eacute;ing the onions, there was no instruction as to what to do with them!! What is that? Like ok great now enjoy your saut&eacute;ed onions some other time, that’s not part of the meal ????"
226863,268917,2018-10-20,5,"I made this last night after work, and we were wowed by the flavor! I was so surprised at how great this is! I really questioned not salting and peppering the steaks, but they were very flavorful and the salt from the tomato sauce was sufficient to enhance the meat. They turned out really tender and delicious. i served over mashed potatoes. Thanks for sharing!"
2002306400,322053,2018-10-20,5,I had this recipe from the box of mac&amp;cheese that I saved from years ago...Yet I lost it and just Googled it and it popped-up!! My kids loved this dish for many years!!! I would add crushed Ritz Crackers and Shredded Cheese to the topping in the Casserole Dish. Perfect with a Garden Salad or Green Beans----Of course I did omit the Corn bc kids didn't want it---But it was a good meal for everyone!!!
2002306988,17944,2018-10-20,4,It turned out good but the penutbutter is just not that yummy
2002157583,145717,2018-10-20,2,"I made, or rather tried to make, this recipe last night as a side dish for pan fried trout. There is a problem here. First of all, the pumpkin doesn't soften sufficiently at a 200 oven in 30 minutes and it is not ready for the pan. Secondly, the instructions say &quot;About 10 minutes before the pumpkin is done, heat the oil in a pan and add the leeks and pumpkin. &quot; I'm pretty sure they mean the &quot;turnips&quot; not the pumpkin. This is just confusing. The final outcome was tasty but not the kind of outcome I expected as there was very little pumpkin flavor. Adding the sesame seeds was a good idea."
2002307075,63828,2018-10-20,5,"PERFECT! EXCELLENT! I will never make Pork Tenderloin any other way. My Pork Tenderloin came in two pieces so I used the suggestion of other reviews and placed both pieces in a pyrex baking pan NOT TOUCHING each other and determined the time based on 1 of the pork tenderloin pieces NOT THE TOTAL WEIGHT Ex; I bought a 3.17 pound pork tenderloin - separated the two pieces so they were not touching in the pan and divided 3.17 pounds by 2 and used 1.58 pounds as my cooking weight. This way of cooking pork tenderloin is no fail and delicious. I will also be using this high heat method for roasts, etc... from now on. Thank you SO much for posting!"
1522598,53508,2018-10-20,5,Charlie was/is a Chicken Salad genius! I made this for an office party for my mother in law and they went nuts! I even got a &quot;Thank You&quot; card!
2002296817,82917,2018-10-20,0,Outstanding soup! I make a fair amount of soups and will admit many of them are above average. I will also admit none of them are better than this. I used a cup or two more of beef broth but other than that followed the recipe. Can't wait to make it again.
2002306379,12909,2018-10-20,4,"Tasty! I used rice wine, a bit less soy sauce, and no garlic at all. The spring onion and ginger were enough. Served it with a little rice, since the sauce is too good to waste. Next time I will just use more oysters. :-)"
2002306263,153642,2018-10-20,5,"Made these without adding to the recipe at all and the muffins were perfect! I only had two bananas, but they were pretty big, and I mashed them until they were as &quot;liquid&quot; as possible... the mixture seemed to be usual muffin consistency so I didn't add any extra liquid to the mix and the muffins turned out lovely and fluffy inside with a nice crust. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
2002307063,32042,2018-10-20,5,"Gumbo is like the human race, diversely good. I’m from New Orleans and this recipe is an Excellent base for SOUTH LOUISIANA GUMBO. Add some bay leaf, pork, pork taso, Worcestershire sauce and you are cooking baby. Thanks"
2001840893,356428,2018-10-20,0,"I have always used Julia’s recipe for onion soup,but,I usually omit the flour part,as I think it takes away from the onion soup flavor..The color is a more creamy brown then I like.I like the clear broth..Also,my mother in-law grew up on a farm I. France,she says always use a mix of chicken broth and beef broth..Which I do ,and,it gives it a nice clean taste with the onions..However,She also reccomends using the blood of a fresh killed chicken too..Which I am not apt to try!"
2002307058,118738,2018-10-20,5,"This is delicious and could not be any easier to assemble. It would make a great dessert for those short on time, and special ingredients. It comes together much like a custard, which I love. It was a hit with the husband, as well. Will make again and again.I served it room temp, totally delicious."
2002307113,216295,2018-10-20,4,This recipe turned out great! Only thing we might add is orange extract/orange zest for a change .... Thanks for the recipe!!
2002307207,440697,2018-10-20,5,"This came out great my first try! I used half a papaya as the fruit, and the Habenero's I had grown myself. Will probably try a ghost pepper version next seeing as I have so many. Thanks for sharing!"
2002245878,393875,2018-10-20,5,I used raisins instead of apricots.
2002306920,283841,2018-10-20,1,"Why the hell would anyone kill a threatened species for SOUP. Go to shop rite and get some campbell's. Take this recipe down, it's a disgrace. I'm not even a vegetarian but this is messed up"
1553446,187817,2018-10-20,0,Made this for a marble birthday cake. It was amazing! Perfectly fluffy with a light cream cheese deliciousness!
2002305828,132263,2018-10-19,5,Amazing. No one would ever know they are different than conventional pancakes.
2002305233,401050,2018-10-19,5,"Wow I thought this recipe was a bit of a long shot considering it's fat free and egg free but I thought the result was great! I will definitely make this again :) (Also, I used 60g stevia instead of sugar and omitted the cinnamon, personally I would add a lil more stevia next time)."
2149656,375073,2018-10-19,5,Delish!
2002305367,341231,2018-10-19,0,"IM BAFFLED..!!!???why did this burn after the 1st 2x worked great?(same day, diff colors)…running out of ingredients-super frustrated."
1802936715,341614,2018-10-19,4,"It was good and easy to make, but didn't have much flavor. Maybe because there was no Italian sausage in it. I buy chicken Italian sausage from Trader Joes and it is really good! Maybe I will try that next."
1713190,339453,2018-10-19,5,I've always cooked a turkey in a roaster pan. Mine never comes out brown on top which we never minded as we just slice all the meat so people can serve themselves easily. I'm going to try and cook my dressing in a 2nd roaster this year. My inlaws always made there's in the roasters and so delicious. Unfortunately they both passed away and no one ever took down the recipe for the electric roaster.?? But I'll give it a try this year!
2002305484,413406,2018-10-19,3,Wasnt to exact liking so i tweaked it and added chocolate chips the second time around and it seemed to spice it up a bit for the kids and i added an extra tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon and it really topped it off!
2002306126,105281,2018-10-19,2,"This is not creamed spinach. it's more like slightly spinached cheese sauce. very tasty... as a dip or appetizer or something. not the side dish i was looking for. having said that, should have known when i saw cream cheese in the recipe... so 2 stars instead of 1. relable this as spinach dip and it probably gets 4-5 stars."
2002305888,130102,2018-10-19,5,Awesome you just have to tweak the recipe sometimes if you feel it has too much of this or not enough of that. I made onion rings as well.
1280189,67352,2018-10-19,5,Look no further. This is the best Imperial cookie recipe. The almond extract makes these cookies special. An the dough is so easy to work with. Store in an air tight container to let the cookies soften.

2002305801,232764,2018-10-19,0,"Question what is it, and what is in it, and what is the recipe?"
2001217958,275041,2018-10-19,5,This was fantastic. I served it over steel cut oatmeal for breakfast for my children. They devowed it. I will use the leftovers in hand pies. The only ‘tweak’ I will make to the recipe next time is to reduce the sugar a bit. It wasn’t at all too sweet. It was just so good that I feel it will be just as good if I reduced the sugar a bit. I’m going to use this recipe to make a pie filling next time with sliced apples.
1663041,443758,2018-10-19,5,"This couldn't be easier, and my family loved it! I added paprika and thyme along with the seasonings, and served it with baked sweet potatoes and green beans. I used a foil-lined baking sheet for easy clean up."
2002306014,171703,2018-10-19,0,PEREFECT!!!
218535,99476,2018-10-19,5,Delicious. Won't change a thing.

2002305735,185445,2018-10-19,5,I made mine with a gluten free flour blend. I used half flour and half oats and then added a cup of sliced almonds and limited the glaze. They're perfect for an easy source o f carbs and protein after I run! Thanks for the base I worked from!

1074735,120426,2018-10-19,4,"Awesome. So excited about this recipe as the veggie burger is all I ever order at Houston’s. 5 star flavor! But 4 stars bc I ran into a problem. Noticed the consistency seemed to wet. I After reading reviews, I added more bran. Thought about adding the whole egg but it was too late. Cooked them on the egg and had to put them on foil bc even with additional bran they were too liquid. Ok so cooked them on one side and tried to flip but they stuck. Flipped them anyway, brushed with suace and added cheese. Beautiful presentation! Delicious flavor. Rivals Houston’s. Just don’t know how to fix the consistency problem so I could put straight on the grill and nix the foil. Or how to prevent the awful sticking to the foil if I have to use foil. Also I added minced garlic, 3 cloves and 1/2 minced scallion. So very good!"
2002305597,339905,2018-10-19,5,Great recipe! Thanks!
2002223636,150384,2018-10-19,0,great
2002305414,132600,2018-10-19,4,"Love this recipe. I only had 2 fillets, so I stacked them and baked them. I did add salt and pepper plus a little old bay. This is a keeper."
2002305435,114729,2018-10-19,5,I have made this for years and not only at Christmas but throughout the year. It's good with romaine letter you can dip it easily. I also use Italian and sourdough bread. .
2002303046,28768,2018-10-19,5,"This recipe is great. A lot like mine, however, I add a pound of mushrooms and I use jarred marinara sauce."
169430,434598,2018-10-19,5,I read the reviews before starting this and used Jackie's suggestion of adding the sour cream last thing and just long enough to heat it. It worked beautifully and I now have another way to enjoy my fav veg. Yum!
2002054249,132546,2018-10-19,5,"I made this recipe with spiced ground chicken meatballs which I browned, dipped in the tempura batter and fried to golden. Both ways the recipe is great. (I used less sugar and more vinegar to make it less sweet.)"
2002093000,39087,2018-10-19,5,"My boyfriend &amp; I love chicken pasta dishes w/heat &amp; this was great!!!l I did not have sun-dried tomatoes on hand (subbed diced tomatoes) &amp; added a bit of parm to thicken sauce. Also added about a tsp. (or 2) more Cajun seasoning, we like the spice! Have seen a few variations of this recipe but this was quick &amp; easy, tasted delicious &amp; will be made again! Thanks for great recipe!"
2001917343,107786,2018-10-19,5,Family loved this recipe. I have to say I go straight to genius kitchen when I'm in need of any recipe as they all have been awesome. These are the best ribs I've ever made. I couldn't find the hickory smoked salt either but took a tip from another review and used a teaspoon liquid smoke. Thanks for making me feel like a genius cook!
2001975416,272930,2018-10-19,0,"This recipe switches between metric and Imperial measures, and between quantities and weights. I am not going to even try to decipher this until the author or GK does the conversions so that it uses one system. In North America we usually go with quantities, so that is how it would logically work, and it is easy to do conversions from metric to Imperial."
2002305453,108231,2018-10-19,5,"This soup was a huge hit. I did add black beans, fresh corn, fresh tomatoes, and cilantro. Skipped the wine and used a little water. I will definitely be making this again."
2002305862,33671,2018-10-19,5,"Came across this recipe while sitting in my car at the grocery store trying to figure out what to make for dinner. With so many good reviews I gave it a try. I am definitely challenged in the kitchen. So I need easy! I followed the recipe exactly- because hey, I don’t know what I am doing. I did put under the broiler after to crisp up the skin. My chicken was a little over 5 pounds and I cooked for 5.5 hours on low. It was GREAT!!! Even my son (possibly the world’s pickiest eater) said he thinks it was the “best chicken he has ever had! I was so excited with the end result that I texted all my friends the recipe. I will definitely be making again!"
2002306058,469333,2018-10-19,5,"Was 12 cups of vegetable broth a typo for 2? I used 4. Rather than adding sugar, I used a small sweet potato (omitting 3 carrots) - made the colour extra rich too. Also used fresh ginger rather than ground. Thank you - I needed a hearty soup to transport and this is tasty."
2002282088,429228,2018-10-19,5,Thank you so much for inventing this recipe! I made this for dinner and it was absolutely the best! I followed your directions exactly. I'm mailing your recipe out in the morning to my girlfriend in Michigan so her family can enjoy it too. Once again Thank You.
16909,22782,2018-10-19,0,This is the only recipe I have use for many years. I divided it in to 4 meals and freeze. So I always have some on hand.
2001427256,296743,2018-10-19,5,"I'm making these ribs for at least the 10th time tonight, so this is a long overdue review! Simply put, this recipe is incredibly simple and so delicious. It may be the only recipe that I don't tweak. Thank you for posting!"

The grocery store in my hometown didn't have kasseri cheese so I used Kraft cheese slices instead. It turned out incredible!!"
2002303114,107614,2018-10-18,5,"Being from Boston &quot;Born and still live here&quot; I've tried other baked beans that other people have made they were good but not as I remember. This recipe nails it down. Yes, soak the beans over night and you'll have fewer broken beans. I'm retired so I have a lot of time and it's 5:30 am and I'm making Boston Baked Beans in a Dutch oven :) More about my Dutch oven later!"
1587409,142488,2018-10-18,5,Great recipe!! Tastes great!! I made the White Glaze Icing from this site to drizzle over the bread :) Great combination!!
2002267861,120560,2018-10-18,4,"Your child will play with the friv games, then eat. Let your child touch the food, help him to play with the food. Allow him to take his fingers to his mouth. So eating, eating, eating should be as enjoyable as playing a game. Small colored plates, heart-shaped breakfast plates, prepared lunches such as picnicking, dinner prepared like playing house, can be transformed into a pleasurable event made with family. It seems difficult for mothers and fathers to give their children food in front of television. Instead they need to turn off the television. Friv needs to find solutions that will increase interest and desire. For example, funny facial shapes, simple games such as airplane flying, eating games for toddlers, interesting and entertaining to eat contribute to your child's movement and cognitive development. When your child is hungry, he can feel grumpy and cry without any reason. Most of the time, these reactions are outdoors. It is necessary to evaluate this reaction well and encourage the child to eat. Can children who do not eat food add a habit of eating with the game? Of course, the game at friv 2 is very important for the development of a child. However, the game should be applied up to 2 years of age. The game can be cooked until 2 years of age, after which the game is not suitable for eating and eating habits. Because we can apply certain rules, we have to give this habit to the child from their early ages. It is an important role model for the child to eat together with the family, to sit in the table together. Even if you have not eaten your food, sitting in the family cafeteria is important for the development of the child. It is best not to make your meal times boring. This is also very important in terms of communication with children. A child who does not eat will want to have a loud tone and different and abrasive expressions will be used. I think it is also important in terms of food. You can make your child's dinner sessions more engaging at some point. But do not take it to the point of a child who opens your mouth like a robot in every advertising cycle, sitting in front of friv unblocked video-recorded ads."
2002305142,100408,2018-10-18,0,I think this is a wonderful mix of spices. It has a bit of a kick which I loved.
2002305288,5418,2018-10-18,1,This isn't Memphis style nor is it Corky's slaw this is an abomination and as a southerner it offends me.
91970,429040,2018-10-18,5,"I normally dislike reviews where the person says that they love the recipe but, then tell you what they did differently :) That is, until this recipe LOL I could not follow it exactly because I wanted to double the recipe but, I only had 8 eggs on hand. I saw that someone had substituted whole eggs successfully and so, I decided to give it a whirl. I used 6 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a double batch and it turned out beautifully. I will hit up the grocery store for more eggs, butter, lemons and sugar and I will be making this again. Thank you for sharing."
2002304994,301028,2018-10-18,5,Very tasty dressing - on slaw or on lettuce salad! Several people have asked for recipe! Love it!
2002164639,320658,2018-10-18,4,"This recipe is a keeper with a few additions. I saw no need for the mixing of the egg, bread crumbs and spices in their own bowl. just added everything to a large bowl with the meat. Added 1/4 grated Parmesan and some garlic powder.. I used a nice pasta sauce from a jar. And placed 1/4 cup in meat mixture since I was only using 1 lb. lined large muffin tin pan with 4 parchment cups. Pressed to bottom and sides. Added 1T of reserved sauce to bottom of each well, added mozzarella to fill and placed a few slices of mini pepperoni (found pre-sliced by Hormel) on top. Baked at 390 degrees for 20 min because of their large size. Turned oven to broil and finished them for 2 minutes. Served with garlic bread and green salad. Too bad I forgot to take a picture."
2002304729,334468,2018-10-18,5,"I made them gluten free by using almond flour, and loved the texture. I'll reduce to water next time as they were far too wet compared to my other recipes."

2002305079,60022,2018-10-18,5,Just got back from Italy and the chef had us baking the eggplant so the dish wouldn't be so oily. We laid a thin layer of crumbs under each layer of the eggplant that gave it a slightly crispy texture. The dish was heavenly! A winner for sure and super easy!
2002127828,223436,2018-10-18,5,I added some basil and chopped celery and garlic my boys loved it so much I have to make them once a week ????

I did only have one box of lemon so used orange as my 2nd box and come out tasting like an orange creamsicle. Can just imagine how good other flavors would also be"
1271506,193920,2018-10-18,5,"We thought this recipe was fabulous. I used the hot version of jarred harissa (I wasn't sure which to use) but cut back on the cayenne to around 1-1/2 tsps. (figuring I could always add more). It was still on the edge of too hot for us (and we're pretty tolerant of heat), so I might cut back to 1 tsp. next time. But we loved the combination of flavors and textures and the fact that the veggies dominated; even hubby, who can be a bit &quot;iffy&quot; about turnips, didn't even realize they weren't potatoes until I mentioned it halfway through (hint, hint!). Served it with crusty bread for dunking tonight and over rice tomorrow. Yum!"
198154,88333,2018-10-18,4,"I made this using the turmeric option. I also used fresh garlic chives. DD didn't care for it at all, but the rest of us really enjoyed it. Served as a side to the sal on we had for dinner."
2002305065,465854,2018-10-18,4,"I find thigh meat isn't as dry, and agree with Paka1931, brown, remove and reduce sauce before finishing. And basmati or jasmine rice."
283012,65861,2018-10-18,4,"There were buttons in the fridge and broccoli in the garden to use up, and this fit the bill. Even with only 2 cups of broccoli on hand, the blend of the two main ingredients came out fine. I also threw in a handful of sunflower seeds and a splash of mystery veggie sauce (leftover from a friend's meal delivery kit), based on reports of blandness by other reviewers, but I don't think that was necessary. I think it would be worthwhile trying out an herb other than rosemary in this recipe."
2002304965,150710,2018-10-18,5,My Aunt use to make these for me all the time. I love these. Going to make them for my son this weekend
2002304782,261889,2018-10-18,5,"My new go to recipe! Excellent cookie!! I did bake on my Airbake pans on parchment paper for 8 minutes, my hubby likes a more done cookie. Also, the frosting was too stiff so I added double the corn syrup and milk and only used vanilla vs almond extract. Perfect!"
2001523205,526696,2018-10-18,0,Turned out well.
2000279491,162994,2018-10-18,5,"Loved it, wish I would have added corn and zucchini. I did omit the sugar (hubby doesn't like sweet foods) will make again!"
2002305254,165908,2018-10-18,0,The amount of celery was left off of this recipe.
2000786484,133751,2018-10-18,4,I gave it 5 stars when I used 4 the brown sugar and a little over a Tbs of honey. I followed directions because I hadn’t made it in so long. Too much honey and brown sugar for us
2001429653,197339,2018-10-18,4,"Very Tasty! However, definitely Does Not need additional salt if you are using salted butter...not sure about unsalted butter. I added in some heavy cream to dilute the saltiness. I put it on butternut squash ravioli, which are very sweet. Next time I will omit the salt and try it on cheese ravioli."
2002198927,53301,2018-10-18,1,I followed the recipe EXACLTLY the way it was written and they came out AWFUL! I'm a BAKER so I know what I'm doing. These cookies did not have that cookie dough texture ... more like a cake batter mess. Never again. What a waste of ingredients.
2002304970,137364,2018-10-18,4,"Overall perfection!!! I've had issues in the past not able to get away from sticky rice. Vinegar is an amazing solution and although I could still kinda smell it, I can't taste it! ?? Thank you so much!!! I will be sharing and using again in the future!!!"
2002304494,57466,2018-10-18,5,"This is delicious! I added nutmeg as suggested in other reviews, and used arugula instead of basil."
2002045176,102566,2018-10-18,3,You said nothing about cooking the pork. I assume you brown it before mixing it with the other ingredients?
2002261969,17080,2018-10-18,0,"Hello, I haven't made this recipe yet but it would be very helpful if all of your recipe directions used fehrenheit for temperature and the measurements were in cups and tablespoons, teaspoons etc. Thank you."
2002304584,489615,2018-10-18,4,"These baked “fries” tasted great (I tossed them in almond meal to create a grain-free crunch before laying them on the cookie sheet and spraying with EVOO)! However, the texture when I pulled the mixture in the 9x9 Pyrex casserole dish out of the fridge (2 days after making the slurry) was too soft and gooey, like Play-Doh! Definitely had not solidified well. Turned out to be a disaster trying to slice it into firm sticks, so I ended up just pulling bits off with my hand, rolling into a cigar shape in my palm, and tossing in the almond meal. Then put these bits back into the Pyrex dish and shoved it into the freezer while the oven was preheating, for about 20 mins. Then laid the still relatively-soft pieces onto the cookie sheet for baking. But the end result tasted great. Next time however, I’ll just directly put the slurry into the freezer and leave it there overnight. Thanks!"
2000374686,269925,2018-10-18,2,"Not fluffy, not soft."
2002305206,272070,2018-10-18,0,I used pork. I also added a can of diced tomatoes. A sprinke a wee sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg in the tomato mixture.
2001962945,536506,2018-10-18,0,Omg! This is SO creative!
1467966,325094,2018-10-18,5,"This is the best creme brulee recipe. I often double it to make extra. The 1 Tbs of heavy cream in the recipe is actually 1 tbs of sugar at the end that you dust over to torch. My husband thinks this recipe is amazing, so I will continue to make it! Thanks for sharing a good one!"
2002305086,235170,2018-10-18,5,I love how they say whilst.
2001997783,322917,2018-10-18,0,"Petra, my first suggestion would be to not slice it until you're going to use it. That being said... With fresh bread you get a day maybe two. That's about it unless you add various preservatives. You can try sorting it in a vacuum container, but it doesn't extend it much."
2002305235,146036,2018-10-18,5,Absolutely delicious! Wonderful combination of flavors.
2002304881,528649,2018-10-18,1,"I'm sorry about the 1 star....that's a mistake... I haven't made the cake yet...I have a question...it states when putting on the layers you start vertical and then horizontal......does anyone know what that means? I get the vertical part, but what layer do you put on horizontally?"
2000157543,537037,2018-10-18,0,"May I have a copy of the recipe. Thank you, Coll"
2002305063,295797,2018-10-18,0,"Fantastic recipe, if you like crunchy texture ditch the nuts sub 1/2 cup granola for the flour. Awesome !"
2002305276,113993,2018-10-18,5,"I used this recipe for the first time I ever made STP, and it was a HUGE hit at the office. People I had never talked to before came up to me to tell me how good it was."
2001770114,454978,2018-10-17,5,Deee-licous! Thanks for the great recipe!
2002304132,288988,2018-10-17,5,Like Janice Z I also added 1/2 block cream cheese but did use the cauliflower as I love it. Funny I never liked this stuff till I started doing LC/Keto. It was wonderful! Also easy... made it over lunchtime. :)
2002304411,155369,2018-10-17,5,"AMAZING!! Broke out my bread maker, after a couple years of it sitting on a shelf, because I just had this urge to try again! Searched the internet for an itialian type bread as I was making a pasta sauce for dinner and came across this one! This recipe was so easy and I am still in shock at how good it came out! I added a tablespoon of the Italian seasoning instead of a teaspoon because I like a little more “flavor” in general!! My 14 year old son is currently devouring his 3rd slice !! Definitely give this recipe a go!!!"
2001563787,456316,2018-10-17,5,This was a huge hit as an appetizer at my Octoberfest party. Nobody could figure out what was in the dip but a common guess was some kind of artichoke dip. My guests were so surprised when they found out the simple ingredients.
2002303895,229078,2018-10-17,1,"Horrible! My Mom wanted pecan pancakes, and I was unfortunate enough to choose this recipe. I followed the directions to a T, and if you like dry, heavy pancakes as opposed to “light and fluffy”, this is it. Equal amounts of flour and milk/buttermilk, so of course they are going to taste like wallpaper paste. Waste of time, money, and effort, and listening to Mom complaining was no fun either."
2001921182,27208,2018-10-17,5,This is very similar to &quot;Mississippi Potroast&quot; except that uses au jus gravy mix and half a stick of butter on top of the roast. It melts down into the juices and adds flavor to gravy if you need any more flavor! Most any tweaks are good. Most grocery stores have dry ranch or Italian salad dressing mixes where the bottled dressings are.
2002304098,100999,2018-10-17,0,this is a very good website and i am doing a project and this is a good website I need to take 2 servings and turn them into 30 serving so thanks for this website
2002304144,27968,2018-10-17,0,can this dough be refrigerated in bowl or pan overnight after kneading to make the next day?
2002304446,2886,2018-10-17,5,"This was the same recipe my great grandmother used. I used salted butter and omitted the salt, self rising flour, vanilla, walnuts, chopped pecans, half white half brown sugar and 8 bananas for a double batch. It made 3 good sized loaves. One for now, one for later and one for the office in the morning"
2002010360,301754,2018-10-17,0,"Excellent, very easy. Emersion blender works perfect for this."
2000709862,419500,2018-10-17,5,"I couldn't believe it! Roast at 500 for the entire time? But yes, folks, it is true! It did get a little smokey in here but following these instructions exactly yielded a moist chicken with subtle flavor. The only thing that I did differently was to add a few slices of ginger with the spring onion. Served with Ginger Scallion Sauce recipe that I found somewhere else and a Pear Gorgonzola salad. Delish and so easy. Pretty quick too if you don't count the overnight air chill. Some rice would have been very nice but if you are trying to limit carbs, this will do!"
2002303802,273166,2018-10-17,5,"I've been looking for this recipe forever! Had it and lost it. :( Gonna make it this weekend for a cookout. Going to use 1 pound smokies and 1 pound mini meatballs. Think I'll triple the amount of sauce, though, in case the meatballs soak it up."
2002304197,192661,2018-10-17,4,Way too much cinnamon
2002303490,528649,2018-10-17,5,this food brighten my day
2001686517,69173,2018-10-17,5,so good! my family loved them.
2002304420,466513,2018-10-17,5,"Alright I made this tonight. It would have been great the way it was described. But, I used butter milk instead, I added an extra cup of cheese, I added 8 ozs of beer, I added 2 tbsp of soy sauce, I put the entire mixture in oven for 30 minutes covered at 375, then 10 minutes uncovered. It was awesome. Great base recipe to add your favorite flavors to."
2002303490,39716,2018-10-17,1,this is way too spooky for me.
2002304397,178370,2018-10-17,5,I loved it so much they were not dense. They tasted great and rose well. I was worried about the consistency when they came out but looked perfect. It was really fun!!!
43815812,119611,2018-10-17,3,"It was very good, but not moist. I don't know why?"
2002303648,124337,2018-10-17,4,Can't upload pictures don't have Facebook. But... this was delicious. Only thing I can say is that the breading gets mushy and my husband doesn't like that but the flavor was great
2002304309,250065,2018-10-17,0,How does adding shrimp to the dish add points since shrimp are free?
2002303743,136746,2018-10-17,5,"This is excellent. We made a couple of alterations. We used flounder because it was in the house. I think you could use any fish you liked. We didn't have thyme so we used basil, and it was fantastic. We also substituted corn meal mix for the bread crumbs and turned it on broil for the last 5 minutes. Someone else reviewed with &quot;restaurant quality,&quot; and I have to agree. I thought that while I was eating it. Can't wait to have it again."
2002304312,393523,2018-10-17,0,"I did this recipie tonight and was delish. I didn't use full pkg of ranch but did add ramano cheese with parm cheese. Real, not cheap cheese. Even my husband critic liked it a lot!!!"
2002178338,272930,2018-10-17,0,Can anyone post the conversions please?
2000547256,272930,2018-10-17,0,It would be helpful if your measurements were in English measures!!
2002204546,272930,2018-10-17,0,I wonder if I could make these with flour and baking powder as opposed to self-rising flour. ANYBODY?????
2001833118,272930,2018-10-17,0,"any way to get measurements in ounces, teaspoons, etc? Don't know grams of flour, etc."
2002303872,431477,2018-10-17,3,I made them and they didn't taste like ice cream. They were still good though. Some people said they tasted like coconut.
2002304440,110223,2018-10-17,4,The flavors were great. I used Yukon Gold potatoes as suggested and unfortunately even after 3 hours in the oven they were way too hard and crunchy. My wife thought they were apples. Did I do something wrong???
2002303626,101954,2018-10-17,5,"This was my first ever attempt at pecan pie. Hubby is a pecan lover, me not so much. So this was a treat I decided to try for him. Turned out, even I enjoyed this!"
2001998025,262140,2018-10-17,5,"I followed this recipe to the t and to say it was absolutely delicious is an understatement! Even our young children ate it and loved it (super picky eaters). Thank you for sharing this recipe, it's definitely a keeper but next time I know to make double the entire recipe for leftovers."
672534,283649,2018-10-17,4,"I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I thought it called for too much rosemary. I followed directions except for using boneless/skinless chicken thighs and just 1 Tbsp. rosemary (yes, I did use fresh rosemary) but even that was a bit much. I think it would have been better with maybe 1/2 - 3/4 Tbsp. depending on how fine you chop it. (I did chop my coarse.) I suggest you start with a small amount of rosemary, taste, then add more if you think it needs it. You will have plenty of time to add more after the sauce has boiled for a while. I will be making this again, but I will also add another 1 Tbsp. butter to the roux and 1 Tbsp. more flour as well. I felt the sauce was a bit thin. I used homemade chicken stock, and that just put the sauce over the top for taste. I do like the taste of Emeril's Essence. This recipe makes a lot, so you can use it for a long time. I sometimes substitute it for seasoned salt. (I've made that stuff before.)"
11205974,89451,2018-10-17,5,"Added pork belly that I crisped up at the beginning of the process, while I was cleaning the clams. I chopped up the pork belly and added it to the roux before adding the clams in. I added a little minced garlic. I sometimes add in crab and shrimp to create a seafood chowder. My family and friends go nuts for it. Add a good crusty bread or put in a bread bowl. YUMOH!"
2002263937,106231,2018-10-17,0,"Just started preparing this. It's not possible to blend 1/2 cup butter (and sugar, salt) and only 2 tablespoons of flour until it resembles &quot;fine crumbs&quot;. It's a paste! I will be modifying. Error? Am I missing smething? Thought you'd like to know."
2002304466,247394,2018-10-17,5,I have done with and without cheese and both turn out awesome. I use half milk and half sour cream but add about a few more tablespoons of sour cream. Done this several times and will do several more.
2002167958,272930,2018-10-17,0,"Please, no more metric!"
2001393227,39087,2018-10-17,5,"My family absolutely loved this. I added shrimp to the recipe, and was fantasic"
2002303490,112797,2018-10-17,0,do i have to use milk or can i use cola??
2002303631,68063,2018-10-17,5,First time ever my pan pork chops have not been dried out and tough. I was doubtful about the directions but followed them and they are spot on!
1802478889,26882,2018-10-17,0,Did you use the crescent rolls in the triangular shape or did you make sqaures out of them? Just wondering if you would lose filling when you roll them up if you used them in the triangular way that they are already in the can.
2646265,50684,2018-10-17,5,"I made these and they tasted wonderful. Plan on using this recipe for annual Christmas cookie swap. Any suggestions on how to mold them so I can slice and bake? I've heard of using a paper towel center for perfectly round ones, but I want to try to do shapes."
2002026358,104086,2018-10-17,5,This soup is delicious I’ve made it so many times. I always add 1 can of corn and 1 can of black beans.
2002304088,262140,2018-10-17,5,This is the best soup ever. I will never use another recipe. Even my one year old loved it! He ate two bowls lol.
2002303299,55587,2018-10-16,0,"I tried these in New Orleans years ago, not knowing what it was they were delicious. Not being a big seafood eater I made it myself and they turned out perfect, so good I them myself and they turned out great change your mind about Seafood."
2002303415,80408,2018-10-16,4,"I made this recipe for Carne Guisada it was very good, I did everything that the recipe said but for me it was too running it should be like a gravy. So the next time I make it I will only use two cups water. Also for the last 30 minutes used the pressure cook on the soup &amp; stew button.."
1060667,510087,2018-10-16,4,"We liked this, but I think the cocoa powder leaves a bitter aftertaste? I even added some beef broth, just because we like our chili with some liquid, and I would have thought that would have toned it down. Regardless it was still delicious and we loved the heat :) :), if you don't like heat as much, tone it down some!!"
2002241573,371660,2018-10-16,5,"My husband and I have been doing keto for the last 2 months... And this dish is a part of our weekly menu, it is simply 'Delish' and soo easy and quick to whip up. I don't have access to french's fried onions so i just place a few slices over the top and braise it so they get nice and charry... Takes the dish to another level!!! Thanks for the recipe mate... It's been a lifesaver."
2002298463,486641,2018-10-16,5,I used a 9 x 9 baking pan for 55 minutes. It turned out great.
2002301935,2886,2018-10-16,5,"Wow, I'm impressed! It's super soft and fluffy, with just the right amount of moisture. I used brown sugar and raisins, by the way. It's really the perfect banana bread!"
2002303498,448980,2018-10-16,4,"Added half tsp more of chili powder and a tsp of hot sauce for more of a “kick”. It was messy to roll, but I’m not a good roller (lol). Turned out great and would definitely make it again!"
1800200914,512810,2018-10-16,5,"oh my goodness, just made this dressing...amazing!"
2002302676,216614,2018-10-16,5,We tried this tonight and it is so yummy! I used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 chili sauce. Fabulous!! Thank you.
2001155361,39023,2018-10-16,5,Hands down the most flavorful and juiciest pork chops we have ever had! Used cast iron skillet and adjusted seasonings to taste. Definitely a keeper!
2001976950,408642,2018-10-16,4,"retired Baker, made the recipe exact way as written then my way of using chilled butter and liquids mixing with a pastry fork, not a wooden spoon plus higher baking temp. Both were very tasty but flatter biscuits using room temp. butter. My method, biscuits rose much higher"
2002302730,435457,2018-10-16,5,Just mush it up with your hands and don't even bother with the mayo and garlic powder
2002302829,468913,2018-10-16,5,Fantastic dish!! Enjoyed eating it
2002303408,206111,2018-10-16,0,Can anyone verify the correct amount of tofu that is supposed to be used? 5-6 oz.? Or 5 - 6 oz. packages?
2001976167,388830,2018-10-16,5,"This is a great recipe! I made a double batch and it produced 13 pints. I used large roma tomatoes, so it was thicker. The lemon juice tastes much better than recipes that use vinegar."
2002302862,28011,2018-10-16,5,"I have tried multiple Fajita seasoning recipes over time without finding one that was a keeper, until I tried this recipe! This recipe has a perfect balance of spices resulting in very flavorable meat without being too light on flavor or overwhelming. For the paprika, I did use half regular and half smoked. After mixing spices together, I rubbed mixture on chicken breasts and tri tip steak and &quot;marinated&quot; meat for a couple hours before grilling on my Traeger."
2001310632,509329,2018-10-16,4,"This is a very healthy dish. Fortunately, I had an onion on hand as it is not listed in the ingredient list, but is listed in the directions. Also, 10 minutes is too long to cook small shrimp. Overall, it is a good recipe, but it could use a little more depth."
680857,82985,2018-10-16,5,"Pretty good recipe, similar to my own (I add cream cheese) but I followed as stated and added 1/2 small onion chopped, 3 small chopped jalapenos, 1 clove garlic all sauteed in the butter and then I folded into the mix with some Mexican Blend shredded cheese and a few drops corn extract. Sooo....good with a bowl of chili during our fist cool evening of the fall! I will try for my cornbread dressing as written with just the corn extract added."
2001936111,58047,2018-10-16,5,"Made this for a family in my church who are vegetarians. Have not had a lot of experience personally with a dish like this, but the results were great...they enjoyed the dinner, and I enjoyed the small amount I held out for tasting! Do have to admit, I added a bay leaf to the mix, as well as rosemary, thyme, and a small dash of red pepper flakes. Will definitely make it again for my family!"
2002303474,57275,2018-10-16,5,This is totally addicting! The only changes I made were using jalepeno pepper instead of sweet green and Mexican style diced tomatoes! Two of us literally ate over half a pan!

2002302691,247155,2018-10-16,5,Absolutely easy and delicious to make. Can be very filling depending on the vegetables you add. Though the rice itself can be filling. It’s a great base or side with main dishes.
1698798,187128,2018-10-16,5,"Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe! I'm 56 and just now able to make time to make my own gravy. This one was awesome because I had some shredded beef leftover, but no drippings. Made this gravy, stirred in the beef and served over mashed potatoes. My husband was in heaven!"
2002303484,461207,2018-10-16,5,"My husband isn't a fan of fish, particularly strong-tasting ones. When rockfish was on sale at our Whole Foods, I decided to give it a try, thinking I would cook it pan fried with a piccata sauce. Voila, this showed up when I went Googling, exactly what I wanted! It was as easy and delicious as all the prior reviewers said, and my husband said it was good."
2002302793,50722,2018-10-16,0,"I seem to have done something wrong as these came out very &quot;crunchy&quot;. The dough had quite the crust. I let them cool and went back to them a couple of hours later. Re heated one and even then it was hard as tile. I stuck to the recipe, baked for about 21 mins as there were lightly browned at that point. What do I have to do to get a soft bun?"
2001363566,186003,2018-10-16,5,"Great muffin! I did add a bit more spice - doubled the cinnamon and added a hint of nutmeg &amp; ginger - but that was really it for any tweaks...which is pretty good for me. Good proportions of sweet and salty (usually a muffin is either too much - or too little - of one or the other). I do typically bake muffins at 400F (and for a bit less time) which I find gives them a nice poofy domed top. Will be making these often, thanks!"
2001542975,498441,2018-10-16,5,I used this recipe to make a bacon cheeseburger meatball with ketchup and mustard for dips. Amazing!! I have had so many fantastic responses and requests to make it many more times!!
2002303409,26370,2018-10-16,5,"I'm going to preface this with the fact that I'm not a cake person. I know, I know. I just generally think cake is stupid and dry and not at all appetizing. I also dislike frosting so... Anyway, my kids wanted to make a cake for their grandma's birthday. Usually, we do cheesecakes for birthdays in our family but I remembered my mom mentioning that her mom used to make her a devil's food cake with buttercream and that it was always her favorite. We used a different buttercream but the coffee in this recipe drew me in. Oh. My. This cake changed my mind about cake. It is so moist, delicious and not too sweet. (Surprising considering there is the same amount of sugar as there is flour.) Not only did my mom and the rest of my family rave about it, but it came together in no time. (Ours was fully baked in 25 minutes.) I've already volunteered cupcakes for an upcoming Halloween party because these are so easy to make. Thank you for my new go-to recipe."
2002303518,212340,2018-10-16,5,"I just made this tonight. I must say, it turned out amazing. I used 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/4 cup plain yogurt instead of 1 cup canola oil, and a tad more than 1/2 cup coconut sugar instead of a whole cup of raw sugar. Also added a couple of tsp of baking powder. I didn't have any nuts so it went nut free but this tasty morsel is not missing a thing. Ate it warm with maple syrup drizzled over it. Very happy tummy!!"
1060667,49176,2018-10-16,5,5 stars for sure!! I used a mix of cheeses and I absolutely loved the green chili's in this. Could eat one for lunch every day :)
2002302618,60350,2018-10-16,5,Really like the final product - very tasty and filling.
2002303416,99476,2018-10-16,4,"Kept to recipe with one exception, I added a quarter tsp of Mediterranean spice. We enjoyed this dinner/ Recipe"
2767225,173666,2018-10-16,5,Excellent recipe! It’s nice to add 1/2 cup of roasted pecans with the bananas.
2002301885,100353,2018-10-16,0,This looks good! I can't wait to try it.
2002297735,440966,2018-10-16,5,My Mom is in last stage heart failure and is comfortable at home with care. We are preparing her sodium restrictive meals .... which is no small effort for a cardiac diet. THANK YOU so much for this recipe! My Mom loved it! Will be making it again for her!!
2002303265,56270,2018-10-16,1,"Sorry guys but I follow the recipe to the T and it's nothing like The Picket Fence Poblano soup. Here's what I didn't like about it: 1. The recipe called for a stock pot. It should have specified a size because I used mine and it huge. Lol 2. It made 3 regular size bowls of soup. I don't see how you can get 8 servings out of this. 5, maybe 6, definitely not 8 unless you're a baby. 3. At the roux part I was not- so- pleasantly surprised that my &quot;roux&quot; looked more like Stove Top Stuffing. It didn't start looking like roux until I added a cup of broth. 4. It's more sweet than spicy. I don't know what made it sweet but I used unsalted butter, regular corn tortillas, and regular half and half. I didn't care for the sweetness at all. You know, it being Poblano soup and all, I was looking for spice. 5. It turned out thick. Like porage. I let it slowly simmer for 7 minutes. Sadly, I'm still on the search for the perfect Cream of Poblano Soup."
2002303128,137364,2018-10-16,5,"Made this rice and I only omitted the white vinegar and added a dash of onion and garlic powder. My stove has low, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and high. I cooked it on 3.5 and it came out perfect! Thanks for recipe I am bookmarking it!! :)"
2002303292,12867,2018-10-16,5,"Many years since I first posted my 5 star rating on this recipe (16 to be exact!) , and we are still using and loving it! Now on weight watchers, I'm even enjoying this soup more, because of the low fat content in it. Thanks once again Lennie!"
2002302821,16182,2018-10-16,0,"Can I add curd to make it Eggless? If yes, please specify how much? Thanks"
2002302630,207845,2018-10-16,3,"I made this exactly according to the recipe. It didn’t taste good at all. It’s so weird, I didn’t really taste any banana or PB?! It was very bland tasting. I used to work at a health food store and made smoothies all day. They sold a Funky Munky and it was delicious! I can’t remember the directions/ingredients unfortunately."
2002302653,95888,2018-10-16,5,"Very good recipe! I used unhulled homemade tahini in it. When finished, mine wasn't too thick at all, as others mentioned. In fact I also threw in a little homemade hummus and it was a great addition."
2002303521,103395,2018-10-16,5,This cake is amazing. I used some sweet potatoes from my garden in it. Its a perfect cake.
2002302800,435054,2018-10-16,5,"Needed a quick slice to have with coffee. Came across this recipe, reD the reviews and thought I’ll give it a go. Wow! Yummo, I did cut the sugar to 1/3 of a cup and that is definitely all you need as the topping is sweet enough. After it was baked and cooled I also sprinkled to with shredded coconut. Now one of my favourite slices. Guys try it!"
2002302438,38638,2018-10-15,0,How do you convert the grams into at lap or cups????
2002302420,76529,2018-10-15,0,First time with this recipe. Not glossy but stiff peaks achieved. No cream of tarter in house so used few drops of lime juice. Loop pretty good. Second time; 4 bottled egg whites &amp; half the Splenda. Lime juice again and added 1/2 tsp dutched processed cocoa powder. Not holding exact shape. Probably the fatty chocolate. Will taste later.
2002301801,114907,2018-10-15,0,2 pounds of cream cheese???????????
2002301652,195888,2018-10-15,0,I'd try either marinara for a good savory sauce or perhaps a garlic aioli with a bit of pomegranate or lemon juice for acidity. I'm going to use ground breakfast sausage &amp; havarti cheese &amp; serve with raspberry preserves.
2002302350,184426,2018-10-15,5,Easy college student meal. Add parmesan cheese to the blend and it becomes even better!
2001429606,47570,2018-10-15,4,"This is my second attempt at making a good, basic dinner roll and these are worlds better than the first! I've shorted one star only because the second rise stressed me out! lol They turned out near perfect, but a bit small. I guess the rule here is after a max of 45 minutes, punch the dough down and start on the second rise. It turns out the heat of the oven, once baking seems to finish the second rise. The other problem I had with this and the other recipe(s) is this; It seems there is not enough dough to make the full amount of rolls listed in the recipes? I started using a 1/3 measuring cup to be sure it wasn't myself messing up the size of each roll. Doesn't seem to matter. I ended up with 39 with this recipe, that's if you want a regular 2-2 1/2&quot; circumference, uniform sized rolls. Just and fyi, make extra dough if you need the full 48 count. Happy Baking!"
2001005949,502124,2018-10-15,5,"The sweet of the mango, the heat of the serrano matched with the acid of citrus pairs nicely with the firm opah."

2002302096,330531,2018-10-15,0,"Amazing, tasty recipe! No one even guessed this was a &quot;low carb&quot; recipe :). Very forgiving recipe, too, if you don't follow the instructions exactly."
362983,101104,2018-10-15,5,"This has definitely been my staple pumpkin pie recipe; I love it! The spices aren't overpowering, it's got a really nice balance of flavours: a bit creamy yet light and still full of flavour. I've made it with a no-roll pie crust (51537) and it works wonderfully. Everyone loves this pie.. it never lasts long in this house! Thanks! [Edit: lately I've made some tweaks. I sub half the sugar for brown sugar, and increase the amount of spices by 1.5 to 2 times the original amounts. Turns out great!]"
2002301790,57042,2018-10-15,5,I love love love this recipe! I just purchased a cooked rotisserie chicken from the market and used that as my chicken and it was excellent ! Yields a large amount so you have alot to spare! Invite some friends or take some to a sick buddy! Perfect!
2002301882,142837,2018-10-15,4,"Very nice, a tad runny but thickens well after few minutes. Putting the beated eggs into a small amount of warm mixture was a brilliant idea to stop curdling. An extra egg could be used for a thicker warmer pudding. I used jasmine rice which added a nice scent. Only issue is far too sweet. Suggest half a cup not 2/3rds. Other spices that were nice were nutmeg, and cloves."
2002302371,261692,2018-10-15,5,This recipe is the best! I saw where someone didn’t have cranberry sauce available and just wanted to let you know that you could replace it with a jar of grape jelly ??
2002302549,28942,2018-10-15,2,"First of all how is this five stars?!? I just made this and there are so many things wrong with this recipe. 1) 3 tbsp is way too much Worcestershire sauce. I used 1 tbsp for a double batch and it still came through strong. 2) soy sauce is also too much. I can only imagine how bad these would be with both the recommended soy sauce and Worcestershire. 3) 1 tsp of filling per won ton wrapper, and this will make 75-80 won tons, Way more than a package of won ton wrappers. I used 2 tsp and was the appropriate amount of filling. Now while I did somehow make a decent won ton for the first time referencing this recipe for ingredients, I will give it 2 stars, but you will be severely disappointed if you use the prescribed quantities."
2002301885,90674,2018-10-15,5,Great!
2002301872,133387,2018-10-15,0,"the cake was moist and very yummy but, the glaze was much too rich. when making the glaze, the recipe calls for way too much chocolate/water/vanilla combo for the size cake it makes. when I poured the glaze over the top of the cooled cake the glaze seeped down in the top and sides, a tiny bit, and then sat on top of the cake. There wasn't room in the pan to pour all the glaze on top. I felt like I was flooding the cake with chocolate and ended up scooping out most of the chocolate glaze that sat on top of the cake. There is a lot of wasted chocolate by making this single cake recipe. The edges of the cake tasted soggy and like bitter chocolate, which I didn't care for. I plan to use a vegan butter cream frosting the next time I make this cake."
2002302123,10199,2018-10-15,5,"When I was a kid, I would insist on Spread-a-burgers, on my birthday. Every year. First time I looked up the recipe. Didn’t know there was tomato soup in the recipe. Definitely going to make them."
914720,53041,2018-10-15,5,"This was a big hit for us. I used 1/2 t oregano, 1/2 t cumin. Used salsa instead of the tomato sauce, and added a can of rinsed/drained black beans. Served over tostada shells. My son is very excited that there's enough sauce leftover for breakfast."
2000863327,466838,2018-10-15,5,Amazing flavor! Cooked perfectly. No more overdone rubbery shrimp. The whole family loved them and agreed these were better than the overrated overpriced shrimp we got in Hawaii.
2001387699,9054,2018-10-15,5,"Signed up with this site just to do a review. DELICIOUS. Perfect. Believe it or not, I ran out of regular all purpose flour the night I made these but luckily I browsed the comments to find another commentor who had used rice flour as a subsitute. Worked great, perfect. Made no difference in consistency or taste compared to other reviews here. Used avocado oil to fry it in. Kids loved it - even my usual picky eater. Definitely drop them in the pan on the smaller side. I used a very rounded tablespoon full, almost the size of a small scoop of ice cream. They did not fall apart at all, kept their shape and cooked evenly. I've made this twice: Once with super creamy homemade mashed potatoes and the other time with a more chunky mashed potato and they both worked just fine, both times. The second batch even had skins mashed in with them and it made no difference - still decicious and held their shape. This is a keeper for sure!"
2002120722,17987,2018-10-15,0,I used a sharp white cheddar in place of parmesan and I prefer Acorn Squash - less sweet than butternut.
2002206003,197922,2018-10-15,4,"Here is my take on this as a first generation lebanese who prepare this salad regularly. First, I would double the parsley for that much burgul. I dont use boiled water to soak burgul. I usually rinse my burgul and drain then add freshly squuezed lemon to burgul snd let it sit for it to absorb the lemon and become soft (this way your salad is not runny with juices). I would skip any pepper, snd I take the seeds out of my tomatoes."
2002301721,68381,2018-10-15,5,"I didn't do the glaze, just the bread. Also, I used Stevia and only 1/4 tsp of salt. Even with these tweaks, it turned out great! I had never seen any bake recipe use so much applesauce before, so it was a bit strange when putting it all together (especially without a drop of almond milk or something in the mixture?). In the end, it came out super moist and delicious. Perfect treat for mid-afternoon tea/coffee!"
2002302203,65005,2018-10-15,5,Nice!
2002295156,198948,2018-10-15,4,"As someone whos eaten rice my whole life, this turned out better than I expected"
2001543440,2886,2018-10-15,5,One of the best banana bread recipes we’ve ever used. Loved it!!!
2000875446,87782,2018-10-15,5,"Excellent. Keep an eye on them because you will likely need to add water a time or two. Good for a Sunday dinner since they take an hour or more to cook. Try them with Tziatziki sauce for dipping, Greek grilled chicken, and a greek salad. YUM"

She taught me it can go on just about anything, from my eggs in the morning to my chicken, fish and rice at lunch or dinner. I am making it tonight for tomorrow, as it sits and seasons through, that makes it all the more delicious!!"
2002302398,120961,2018-10-15,5,"I do this at least once a month, but I always pre toast the bagel a bit to keep the sauce from making the bagel soggy."
2001951999,2886,2018-10-15,5,Easy and delicious! I did add the extra banana and followed everything else as written! Our new go-to.
2002302285,292268,2018-10-15,4,This is as close to REAL Egg Foo Young that I've loved since childhood!
2002302409,368209,2018-10-15,1,Weird and gummy crust.
2002301668,178865,2018-10-15,5,"I Dont even like chili - but this made me switch teams!! Used Modelo Negro for the beer, used jalape&ntilde;o juice from the slices in a jar, stewed tomatoes with green pepper and onion added, great recipe!! Oh and added some liquid smoke. ??"
2002301647,60720,2018-10-15,5,I would have taken a picture but it was gone so fast I didn't have a chance. People around here a reluctant to try new foods so this was approached with scepticism. This came out fluffy and light. I cooked in a microwave. I used the food processor and baked in the toaster oven. Used 2 eggs and three turnips. I'll be making it for Thanksgiving. Delicious.
2002301009,71849,2018-10-15,4,"They looked good while in the oven. But when mixing it got dry, so I added 1/4 of a hot glass of milk. In the end, I also added chocolate chips. They were so good my family kept asking me to make more"
266635,481960,2018-10-15,5,"Great tasting shrimp and it went so well with your glazed grilled salmon tonight. I didn't use as much red pepper flakes as called for, but the flavor was still really nice. Loved the sherry addition."
2002302014,89164,2018-10-15,0,"This is an excellent receipe,I doubled the ingredients. So fast,so easy...love it,have it memorized so it will be made many more times..thanks!"
2002301127,218193,2018-10-14,5,First try and it was fantastic. My favorite to date.
2002300406,448972,2018-10-14,5,"rotissiere chicken. canned potatoes, canned corn, froz peas and carrots. I used 2 boullion cubes and lots more spices than noted. I thickened it more than 1/4 c flour. Also I did not butter the bottom phyllp. Delicioius"
2002301544,344358,2018-10-14,4,Very thick batter. Lots of sugar. But.. it did rise and the top turned out with a crisp sugar crust. Cook too long and that sugar will burn. Dont cook long enough and that thick batter wont cook. Turned out ok for needing something fast when i was out of eggs and milk! I might tweak and make again.
1612230,32668,2018-10-14,1,"So disappointing, but a good starting point. This recipe is on Mimi's Cafe Website, btw, so they put it out there, and I suspect it's intentionally &quot;off.&quot; First off, all I taste is baking soda. Two teaspoons of baking soda seems like a LOT. Most muffin recipes of similar volume call for 1/2 to 1 teaspoon. I'm not sure why this one calls for two. I'll use 1 tsp on my next try. They are also dense and dry. I'll be reducing the flour by 1/4-1/2 cup. Bland. Not enough sugar, not enough spice, needs some salt too! And vanilla. Only calls for nutmug and cinnamon...and double nutmeg than cinnamon. Needs cloves and maybe allspice. The topping ratio of nuts to sugar seems off and it all just falls off. This time I'll press the walnut pieces into the tops, and then sprinkle on the sugar/spice mix. And I'll try moving to the top rack the last few minutes to attempt to caramelize the sugar a bit and make the nuts more toasty."
2002301491,75758,2018-10-14,1,Horrible. Literally no flavor what so ever. Tastes like bland undercooked chicken with cheese. I’ll stick with beef and taco seasoning
2002300709,205890,2018-10-14,0,Just like my Mom's
2000498330,290136,2018-10-14,5,An easy way to get your morning bowl of oats. Creamy and perfect texture. Used Splenda brown sugar and added a little more because I like mine sweeter.
2002300694,349246,2018-10-14,5,Came out great. I used 2 tbsp of bournvita instead of cocoa powder &amp; topped up with Hershey chocolate spread. Thanks
1686076,71985,2018-10-14,4,"This turned out pretty well but I HAVE to take issue with the addition of the potatoes and carrots in the last 30 minutes. Not long enough! Both were still kind of raw. I will throw them in earlier(as my instinct told me to do at the time) so that the stew texture is a little more even. Taste-wise, this was good. Cinnamon added an interesting, almost smoky note. Might think about adding a little chipotle flavor next time."
2002300746,39225,2018-10-14,0,is there anyone out there who knows the recipe for Dutch &quot;gevulde almandel koekjes?
2002258153,117575,2018-10-14,5,"Just made it and it is cooling in the fridge, will use it tonight with our Ahi nori panko crusted tuna along with a sweet Japanese sauce. Thanks for the recipe as normally I buy the ready made which is a sorry representation. Hope it tastes as good as I expect tonight."
2002301474,380632,2018-10-14,5,"Question, can I reuse the juice and spices a second time? These were wonderful. Exactually what I was looking for. Left out the red pepper flakes because I don’t like the heat and used a cabbage leaf on top to keep the cukes covered."
2002301536,14357,2018-10-14,0,It came out pretty good I tweaked it by putting vanilla extract into the batter mix also added pie filling cherries and maraschino cherries. I also cut tidbits of pineapple and put it into the batter as well.
2715333,50046,2018-10-14,5,"Best tasting bean soup I’ve ever made. Just a few minor adjustments, used ham hocks as ham bone not available. Used part beef broth. Also did not strain through sieve, preferred chunky. I think the Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice kicked up the flavor."
2002301623,183806,2018-10-14,0,Not bad except i cooked them at 450 for 15 minutes and they were pretty burnt. I did them again at 350 for 15 minutes and were a lot better.
2002300998,276465,2018-10-14,2,How big is the diameter supposed to be? Mine turned out undebaked eben after leaving it in for a longer time. There is a baking soda aftertaste but it dissipates. I didn't add sugar though. Would that create the aftertaste?
2002289618,90771,2018-10-14,0,"For anyone on carb restrictions, substitute the brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar or any other brown sugar substitute according to the recommendations."
2002301174,520952,2018-10-14,0,Added celery. Next time I will slice veggies instead of chopping. Wonder if bok choy would be good as well.
2002301591,255067,2018-10-14,0,"Love it! I made a half bath and it turned out great, except I find that it crystallises within a couple days and within a couple weeks there's a thick layer of crystals on the bottom and up the sides.

2002301553,238319,2018-10-14,5,"This is how I make my red rice. I live in and was born and raised in Charleston, SC. We usually dont use measurements but I decided to adhere to this recipe to see if it would come out the same. It came out almost identical. I only used rogerwood smoked sausage this time but I usually use bacon and sausage just like the recipe. Now I have a recipe to give when people ask how to make it!"
2002300919,469754,2018-10-14,0,My grandmother made this all the time. So happy I found this recipe.
2001740504,60350,2018-10-14,5,"This is how my family made mac and cheese as I was growing up, except we used velveeta. It's way better than baked versions! This recipe features a pretty standard way to make a creamy cheese sauce - just remember to take the time to cook your roux and add milk slowly while whisking. I've made it both with skim and whole milk and never had any issues, as well as different varieties of cheese. I highly recommend trying smoked gouda at some point with some chopped sun-dried tomatoes mixed in (perfect for ravioli). As is, this recipe is perfect comfort food."
2000498330,508740,2018-10-14,5,Awesome bread. Very &quot;Italian&quot; smell and flavor. Nice crust w/ fine crumb. Served with soup--perfect.
2002301397,197398,2018-10-14,5,I made it using 2 tbsp of corn starch and 1.5 c milk instead of the 1 tbsp flour and evaporated milk. It sure stands up well! The reccommended amount of sugar and spice are probably perfect. I overtweaked with less sugar and too much cloves. Next time I would try rice flour.
2002300564,142739,2018-10-14,0,"Delicious brownies. Crunchy edges and moist cakey center. I prefer cakey over fudgy brownies so these were perfect. I used a cup of white sugar and almost a quarter cup of brown sugar instead of 100% white. I greased the bottom of the pan with coconut oil instead of using foil, but I think that may have made the brownies heavy and rich throughout since I already used the stick of butter in the batter. Next time I will either flour the pan as well, or just use the foil as the recipe called for. This recipe is so easy and I get to use all top quality, organic ingredients so I will never buy a mix again! And of course the flavor is far superior than that of a mix."

2002121879,123316,2018-10-14,1,This is not real Texas chili. Texans don’t use ground beef or breakfast sausage.
2002094626,187652,2018-10-14,0,"Awesome. Its turned out great. I made one change, less broth and added a can of diced tomatoes in juice."
2002300997,410919,2018-10-14,0,Thought I grabbed a pot roast but it’s an oven roast-I’ll kill it!
2002300835,94198,2018-10-14,5,Really enjoy using this recipe for when I make hamburgers. Taste great when I cook them on the grill.
2002296971,2886,2018-10-14,5,Made it exactly as recipe called for. Family loved it. Best banana bread!!!
2002300495,107575,2018-10-14,0,"Delicious! I added 1/8 teaspoon of sea salt for a little &quot;salted caramel&quot; kick, an improvement in my opinion"
2002301508,178865,2018-10-14,5,"I swapped out the beef for some fresh wild duck breast from my hunt earlier today, and it was absolutely amazing. For the beer, I used Deschutes Black Butte Porter. I can't wait to make this again."

2002300441,340111,2018-10-14,5,"I hate the store-bought gluten free breads and, since I’ve found that spelt doesn’t set off whatever my wheat/gluten issue is, I decided to try this recipe. Delicious!!! It was a hair too much liquid, but otherwise perfect. I used 3 cups of spelt and half a cup of gluten free all purpose flour to start, and it was amazing. I’m going to make sandwich rolls next - thank you for this recipe!"
2002301537,321053,2018-10-14,4,I season my chicken really good with Adobo first and then I brown it. I also add a 8oz can of Corona with 2 cups of Chicken stock. I feel like that helps with the salt intake.
2002300463,380004,2018-10-14,0,The best of the best. We love it. Why should there be any other kind when this is superb.
209747,67534,2018-10-14,5,"I have made these for years! This is hands down the BEST way to make saut&eacute;ed mushrooms. Over the years I have developed lots of changes like less oil and butter, different liquids and herbs but what makes this recipe is the TECHNIQUE shared here. Leave mushrooms WHOLE! Slicing them will allow them to just release a lot if liquid and steam rather than saut&eacute;ed properly. Put them cap side down in a hot pan with enough oil to coat the surface with a light layer of oil. Relax! They may (will) stick but Do NOT TOUCH until they are super carmelized. They will release once the Maiilard reaction has taken place. Don't know what that is? Learn here. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction That is the secret key here! Excellent recipe. Try replacing wine with a good brandy, cognac, bourbon etc., just use caution and add it AWAY from the stove top. It will flame up! Enjoy!"
2001341795,50979,2018-10-14,5,"So delicious!!! I made veal cutlets instead of chicken and used 1 tsp lemon extract instead of fresh lemon (next time will use 1/2 tsp extract or a fresh lemon as was a bit too lemony). Easy to follow instructions, quick to prepare and absolutely tasted like a restaurant quality meal. Served over riced cauliflower with green beans. Will definitely make again, thank you!"
2002301365,519326,2018-10-14,0,Can you freeze the dough and bake at a later time?
2002301367,276903,2018-10-14,0,Why does the recipe require kosher salt? How does that affect the flavor compared to regular salt?
2002301360,118010,2018-10-14,5,"Very good. Substituted brown sugar with 3 packages of sugar substitute, (due to diabetic family member) also added a tsp of corn starch to water. thickened sauce very nicely. Added ginger. Cooked separately but added at the end as instructed. It was delicious."
2002300398,272020,2018-10-14,5,We liked this recipe for its ease and great results. I would have added more cayenne pepper (1/2 teaspoon) for some zip. Used mango and passionfruit preserve for the topper. I might try slicing the pork into medallions at the beginning to get a nice PB crust on the pork. Thanks for posting this recipe.
2002224770,111257,2018-10-14,3,"I'll try any Chicken with Dumpling recipe and usually like or love it. Simple comfort food. This was okay. A little bland, so would add more seasoning and salt (or better-hot sauce) next time. Though I doubt I'll do again - too much chopping and preparing vegetables. But I had all the ingredients, so thought I'd give it a go. However, my biggest complaint with this is the dumpling part. I had Jiffy mix, but never used for dumplings and it didn't work for me. Followed directions to the letter, and they looked great when all was done, but as soon as time came to ladle and serve, they completely dissolved and as a result I lost half of the recipe's title. I've used Bisquick's dumpling recipe in past recipes and they always set firm and never dissolve. I recommend using Bisquick."
2002301119,335120,2018-10-14,0,"also, they may put jalapeno minor in it...I doubt it...it has no spicy flavor at all...but even this amount would be off...lemon, maybe...I always put lime....but maybe both. No sour cream...and definitely more than one large...I make it all the time, one large would not present as much as they give you. BTW, I eat their guacamole all the time......."
2002300946,471140,2018-10-14,5,"Thank you! My great grandmother, born in 1891, would make this for family dinners and my mother would always tell me not to eat it all! I’m so happy to have found this recipe! It brings back happy memories."
2002301495,165254,2018-10-14,5,Really wanted a steak tonight. Tjis was perfect!!!! I dont think Ive grilled a steak as successfully as this brolied one turned out. Loved it and hit the spot.
2002300976,252128,2018-10-14,4,"The original Noah’s Ark Clam Chowder did not contain onions. (I would have never ate it back then if it did). However the rest of your ingredients are like the original. So easy and so good. I’ve been making it this way for many years and the guest I serve it to can’t believe how easy it is. I like to heat it up in the morning, cover and set in the refrigerator until about an hour before I’m going to serve it. Then heat it up on low for about an hour, stirring occasionally. The flavors have time to mingle and you will get a deep rich flavor this way."
2002300360,231701,2018-10-13,5,love this recipe I have made it several times always turns out and today was storming and still turned out. I used whole milk and followed recipe

2002299391,121066,2018-10-13,5,This recipe was great! I used homemade noodles and have never used spices when boiling pasta but it turned out great.

2002299380,16887,2018-10-13,5,Turned out perfect!!!! So good!!!
2002300341,388830,2018-10-13,5,Used Roma tomatoes. Came out wonderful. Nice and thick.
2001091482,154142,2018-10-13,5,"Was really good. Good taste and good crust. My starter was pretty old so mine had a good amount of &quot;tang&quot; which I love. I didn't get quite the rise I was hoping for. That, of course, could be a factor of my starter and the atmosphere. I did find that I had to let the dough rise longer than expected. So, all in all, I would really recommend this recipe."
2000927588,34499,2018-10-13,5,Great recipe!! The pork chops were tender and very flavorful!
2002299666,17823,2018-10-13,5,I go to a Friendship Program during the day and one day a staff member had wanted to make a recipe that a companion for one of the other clients had given her &amp; low &amp; behold it was that recipe I have been thinking about looking it up for quite a while now or asking the staff member who has the class for recipe swap but I keep forgetting to do it. Finally I have looked it up.
532289,128380,2018-10-13,5,This has been in my recipe box so long I forgot I saved it. Found it looking for something else. I have pan fried potatoes for years and they have never turned out as well as being baked in the oven. I can't tell you yet how they freeze as I'm eating them fresh from the oven and rating while I eat. I don't think I will ever cook them in a skillet again. I also used the tip by James D. and placed the potatoes back in the bowl and mixed the oil and spices. It was so easy to pour the potatoes out of the bowl and onto the pan already seasoned. Thank you both. I also cooked the potatoes on parchment paper to keep them from sticking to the pan.
233829,53301,2018-10-13,5,"If you love chocolate the you will love these cookies. I read through many reviews and did tweak the recipe based on the many ideas I read. SOME people complained about a dry, flat cookie so I lowered the flour by 1/2 cup and that probably helped with the dryness. I also did half sugar/half brown sugar. The cookies came out of the oven puffy but did flatten out as they cooled. But I care more about taste and texture that I do about thickness and these cookies were nice and chocolate-y and moist. No one had a problem eating more than one, lol."
2002062813,392356,2018-10-13,0,"I line the pan with foil, add a wire cooling rack, place the bacon on the rack. Then I take a second nesting pan, put foil on the underside of the second pan, place it on the bacon then place a foil-wrapped brick in the second pan. Crispest bacon ever. Toss the wire rack into the dishwasher."
2002300022,528058,2018-10-13,0,I like the idea of a sheet cake pie.

2001762490,73166,2018-10-13,5,Delete the brown sugar &amp; mix several types of beans &amp; it's perfect!
2002234962,150384,2018-10-13,5,"I created my own recipe for BC soup and this recipe is the only one that is almost the same. That being said, when I try a recipe for the first time I follow it to the letter otherwise it isnt the same and will rurn out differently. It isn't fair to say that the recioe didnt turn out when adjustments were made. If after following the recipe the first time you arent satisfied then next time start making adjustments. The recipe has to be given a chance first."
2002300348,74691,2018-10-13,0,"This recipe is easy, fun and it turns out great! I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and I added 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. I baked it a little longer than 12 minutes so it wasn't as fluffy as I would have liked, but I will definitely make it again. I also added a little more sugar (1/4 cup) but if you have it with jam, the sweetest is perfect! Enjoy!"
2002299414,142387,2018-10-13,5,I followed the recipe to the T. It turned out extremely delicious and was super easy to make. The only issue was when I took the dough out of the break maker the dough was super sticky and extremely hard to roll out to shape the challah. Any suggestions for next time to improve the shaping of the actually dough ?
2001928915,181769,2018-10-13,0,"Made this today. I chose to use ground pork instead of beef, doubled the amount of tomato sauce, omitted the V-8 and reduced the pasta to one cup. Other than that I kept it the same. Soooo tasty! Thanks for sharing!"
2002299729,65239,2018-10-13,5,"PERFECT. We served it yesterday, to 5 very happy friends. It was very easy and the instructions were fine except one tiny correction.. Ingredients say almonds but instructions say pecans .. We all enjoyed this delicious dessert !!!!!"
2002299406,91827,2018-10-13,5,"So I worked at PH in the 90's when they actually made dough. I opened the store and mixed andproofed all the dough. I suspect it is all frozen today so to say it doesn't taste like PH hmm. This recipe will make 2 large PH pan pizzas. I bought a PH pan off of ebay. You need the oil - it is basically fried pizza dough. And there was a lot of oil in those pans. The trick is putting the pan in the right temp oven on the right rack for the right amount of time. I think any dough recipe works, just depends on hydration and weight. Nothing like the first personal pan pizza that came out of the oven for the day!"

2002300034,130343,2018-10-13,1,These turned out terrible! They were super dry while making so added extra oj like another person posted. They didn't rise at all and were tasteless!
2002299896,105365,2018-10-13,0,"can you add other vegetables to this and it would still be as good for you? like cauliflower, bok choy, spinach, mushrooms, beets???"
2002299576,438888,2018-10-13,5,"Awesome starting point recipe for me. I never follow directions. So cooking, baking is always an adventure. My loving wife is ever so tolerant that she allows me the lattitude to play with recipes. I used 4 Ghost Peppers and 1 Carolina Reaper instead of Red Chillies. Also added Orange zest and a handful of Frozen Mangos."
2002299521,475950,2018-10-13,4,"I liked this one, it's a tasty way to get in the dark leafys :) I made this in the &quot;Italian style&quot; mentioned in the directions; my only tweaks were to use jarred vodka sauce and add 1/3lb ground pork, for fat and for flavor. Turkey can be so dry, so I added the pork fat to help keep it moist. Mine came out moderately dense, and I prefer a fluffier loaf, so I will add a handful of breadcrumbs or cooked rice next time (I was surprised the recipe did not call for breadcrumbs). I'll be making these again with tweaks. It's very easy. quick to prep, ditch in the oven for a while, then it's ready to serve when your oven timer goes off."
2002300327,244193,2018-10-13,5,Instructions were easy to follow. The cheesecake turned out perfect. No cracks. Just a hole in the middle for temp. So perfect I didnt want to cover it with a mirror glaze. But I had to since it was a birthday and themed. Daughter loved it. She doesn't like sweets. But loved this. Be warned this does take about 4-5 hours to complete. Worth it
2002074047,198707,2018-10-13,5,Excellent soup. The best I've made. I added 1 t. poultry seasoning and used chicken thighs. Really easy using the slow cooker!
157425,481999,2018-10-13,5,No better flavor combination than cranberry and orange! I boiled the water on the stove then added the tea bags and orange rind to steep. Did not make the ice cubes so added slices of the orange to my pitcher along with the cranberry juice and sugar. I like a bit of tart so didnt add all the sugar. Not only is this tea fantastic iced it is so good warmed in the microwave for our cold rainy weather too. I agree with the other reviewer wish we could give 10 stars! Made and reviewed for the Think Pink - 2018 game.

157425,511708,2018-10-13,5,I am not a big breakfast eater but I really enjoyed this muesli! Had some fresh blueberries in the fridge so added them to the mixture. This would be a nice treat any time of day. Made and reviewed for the Football Pool - Week #3
2002288593,210814,2018-10-13,5,just the right amount of seasoning. I followed recipe exactly.
2001873150,66241,2018-10-13,5,"These were phenomenal. They were fluffy and tasty. I made them plain this time but may jazz them up with blueberries, bananas or chocolate chips in the future. A new favourite recipe for sure!"
280271,261260,2018-10-13,5,I did a test run this evening...we are invited to attend a friend group gathering tomorrow evening and I wanted to make sure this would work...and it did... I served this with the Triscuts as suggested and it worked great...thanks for posting your recipe...
2002299048,317246,2018-10-12,5,"Tried this recipe with dried blueberries instead of dried cranberries it turned out great! I have tried fresh blueberry in recipes and the bread breaks up so much, with the dried blueberry it stayed together better. I like lemon and blueberry together and orange and cranberry together"
1346566,5000,2018-10-12,5,This was very tasty and pretty close to CB's version!
2002295965,12365,2018-10-12,4,Great quick recipe! I added some Philadelphia cream cheese for a creamier taste. Soooo good!!

2000744559,412473,2018-10-12,5,"I love this recipe! I have been vegan for over 10 years and have probably tried every store bought vegan sausage available. I even bought a few vegetarian ones. (Sshhh, don't tell.) I couldn't find one that I liked. I have used it in sausage gravy so far, but will definitely find other uses for this fantastic recipe."
2002274586,99476,2018-10-12,0,I also was not crazy about this recipe. Found it to be bland as written. Maybe adding some spices would improve things but not a keeper for me.
128473,288245,2018-10-12,5,"What a lovely cake, it was moist and a little dense. We enjoyed the flavor of the cake very much. It melted in your mouth.

2002298601,98859,2018-10-12,5,I always start with apple cider or juice instead of water . This is the best recipe if you don't want super sweet sauce. I like it to taste like the apples.

Usually, tenderize the veggies when browning the meat. Sometimes, mix ground pork with beef. My bowl gets a few dashes of hot sauce. Always a hit!"
2002299153,29185,2018-10-12,4,Instead of vegetable oil use 1 cup Dr. BRONNERS organic virgin Coconut oil. Omg its so good and nutty you can eat it from the jar. Makes the bread so moist and wonderful!
128473,378718,2018-10-12,5,"Wow, wow, wow. I loved this simple treat. What a great sandwich without all the cream cheese. I was amazed by how much you could taste the small dollop of cream cheese. It was truly perfection, allowing the smoked salmon and red onion to shine. Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will enjoy often. Kudos my friend on making it into my Best of 2018. Made as written wouldn't change a thing for Think Pink 2018"
2002299017,508353,2018-10-12,0,"@Sulfite-free. Many canning recipes call for bottled lemon juice because it has a higher acidity than some commercial lemons. For water bath canning of tomatoes, even unripe tomatoes, acidity is critical. I think you can make this safely using fresh lemon juice by adding citric acid. How much? I would use the amount recommended on most citric acid bottles (follow instructions for canning tomatoes)."

2002299357,137364,2018-10-12,2,I followed this recipe to the T. It burned on the bottom and side and when I taste tested it it tastes like vinegar. I have a gas range...so maybe this recipe is meant for electric stoves?
2002298583,60350,2018-10-12,5,this recipe is totally worth making. Its simple and easy and I totally recomend Add - garlic powerder and use mexican cheese its so good. note - you don't have to go with the amount of cheese it recomends

2002298573,105484,2018-10-12,5,Yummmy! My family loved it but I had to tweak it just a little bit ??
198154,495779,2018-10-12,3,Made this for my family for dinner. Followed the recipe to a T. My family said it was good but didn't have as much flavor as they had hoped it would. Next time I'll try increasing the garlic and ginger and making more sauce.
2002299315,206959,2018-10-12,0,"Every time I see reviews/comments for this recipe, I keep seeing people saying that they use precooked canned beans and therefore they don't need as much broth. The reason that this was the favorite thing on the menu at Timothy's Restaurant is the way it was made. The DRY beans are cooked IN THE BROTH which is what makes it so darn wonderful. My cousins always have made it using shortcuts and they can't understand why mine is ALWAYS SO MUCH BETTER ! I use the original Tim Barnes recipe. Timothy's was always my favorite restaurant in Louisville Kentucky."
2028049,97438,2018-10-12,4,"I will definitely make this again, but will probably decrease the heat a bit so it doesn't Brown the top so quickly - the underside needed a bit more time to catch up, I also would decrease the salt and increase the sugar, since I prefer a slightly sweet cornbread. Loved using my sourdough starter excess and making it in my cast iron skillet. Great with chili and for breakfast. Excellent texture, not dry or too crumbly!"
2001249838,52272,2018-10-12,5,This was really good! I added extra clams. No dill because I did not have any. But other than that followed exactly. I was a little leery of the cream of celery but I think it enhanced the flavor. Thank you for this recipe!
2001513060,52272,2018-10-12,5,"The best clam chowder recipe, that I have tried yet, and I have tried so many that I have been disappointed with. This is a keeper and I will make it over and over again. I followed a few of the other reviewers comments and added some diced celery, which I cooked with the bacon. I also prefer half &amp; half instead of heavy cream. I left the dill out, but that is a matter of preference. Oops forgot I added a bottle of clam juice"
2000356355,282620,2018-10-12,3,"I mean, what's not to like? It's potatoes and ground beef. But it absolutely needs pepper and a T or 2 of butter for SOME flavor. We put a runny egg on top day two...THAT was great"
2002299302,104766,2018-10-12,5,Made this tonight and it was delicious. I added a few candied jalepenos and the sweetness of those really took this recipe over the top!
2002298826,294532,2018-10-12,4,"I've made hot buttered rum jello shots with lemon jello as well, and they were a huge hit! (Yes, you use real butter in them!) Replace vodka with spiced rum, add cinnamon, nutmeg, Jamaican allspice, and a little bit of butter and brown sugar, and voila!"
305531,482036,2018-10-12,5,"Yum. I made 2 small individual serving dishes of these and it worked really well. They were easy to make and went really well with a steak and some mushrooms. Thanks for sharing, Lynn."
2000152793,24189,2018-10-12,5,I really enjoyed this. It was truly delicious.
2002241843,282040,2018-10-12,5,"I've made this twice, yum yummy. Best frosting ever. Please make it pinnable to Pinterest."
2002139307,37081,2018-10-12,0,Been living in Maine for 34 years. Never made one of these. Gotta try it now that most of the tourists are gone. Leaf season is almost over.
2002299196,4904,2018-10-12,0,"This is a great recipe, came out great with and without nuts. Will try vanilla next"
2002299061,27208,2018-10-12,0,I made it EXACTLY as you wrote it and &quot;NO TWEAKS&quot; which is so hard for me. But anyway ABSOULETY THE BEST EVER and it's so addictive especially the demi-glaze. Thank You Babsy!!!!
2002099701,531577,2018-10-12,5,"An absolutely brilliant recipe! Everyone, including my dog, was simply ravenous for it. Adding to its virtues is the fact that there is no pasta in it, only cauliflower, chickpeas and spices. I've made it twice and each time I lacked one or two things, but that didn't detract from it. The first time, I was missing red pepper, OJ, cilantro and pomegranate seeds but added raisins. The second time, I again lacked red pepper and OJ, apricot, but added dried cranberries, currants, preserved lemon strips. Both were wonderful, but the dried apricot added a hit of texture and sweetness, and should be included if possible. Both times, I used an entire head of cauliflower, chopped in my Cuisinart. With the remaining parts, I cooked the stems and leaves with aromatics (carrot, onion, celery, garlic, herbs) and broth to make creamed cauliflower soup, whipped up in a blender. No waste and all delicious."
2002298711,290595,2018-10-12,5,"I am not a mustard/mayo person, so I needed to find my own version of deviled eggs I could enjoy - and this one is it! You need to try substituting the reg. ranch dressing with Southwest/Chipotle Ranch dressing though...gives the recipe a kick with a delicious southwest/smoky flavor! Not at all bland...these are always gobbled up at our get-togethers."
2397100,185704,2018-10-12,5,"The observation about the cream cheese turned this recipe into what I remember from the restaurant. I did make one or two tweaks though. Firstly, I ditched the parsley and oregano in favor of chiffonade of fresh basil. I added the zest of an entire lemon to the sauce. Then, in lieu of chicken broth or clam juice I did something to up the ante: instead of discarding the shells from my shrimp(I found large colossal shrimp on sale but it needed peeling), I took put them in a large stock pot. I threw in a quartered onion, a couple of stalks of celery, a bay leaf and boiled them until I had a fragrant broth. This is the same broth I put in the sauce."
2002297286,537089,2018-10-12,5,I haven't made it but I would either use real fruit jam like raspberry and strawberry and black grapes or whatever red fruit you can find mush the fruit and boil and add sugar and water and maybe some syrup just a tad and blend well. Or mix the jams together and blend together. Or you could also use Jolly ranchers red ones and a little corn syrup and or cornstarch for thickener and some water and melt on stove and add some jam in there as well. I'm gonna tackle this for a church party and see how it turns out.
2002298545,264721,2018-10-12,5,Many pumpkin bread recipes made 2 loaves and I only have 1 pan so I decided to try this recipe and don’t regret it. I used canola oil and 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 granulated sugar. Bake time is accurate. After slicing the bread I spread some butter on and sprinkled it w/ cinnamon sugar.
305531,118409,2018-10-11,5,"Such a simple and delicious dessert. I plan on making this again when the grand kids come over next time. Thanks for sharing, Lori, and congrats on your football win."
2002297755,103215,2018-10-11,0,Excellent turn out!!! I also stir fried bok choy served on the side. I will cook again.
2002298088,66409,2018-10-11,5,I used vanilla almond milk instead of cows milk and Served them with pumpkin butter ! Yum!
2001604211,82109,2018-10-11,0,im gonna try mm's. smarties are a tart candy. im thinking not in this sweet recipe.
2002298475,35393,2018-10-11,5,So yummy! My 5 year old enjoyed helping make them and eating them. My husband doesn't usually like muffins but LOVED these.
2002298470,61906,2018-10-11,5,I've made this several times. I love making this when I'm feeling like baking something and I don't feel like cookies or brownies or whatever. My husband loves it. I make it in my 8x8 and it's perfect.
2002298017,73172,2018-10-11,0,Where do you buy green chilli flakes?
2002183553,2886,2018-10-11,5,Delicious banana bread! I added chocolate chips and pecans. Yom!
2002297745,478124,2018-10-11,5,So far so good! On the plate cooling. The top of my cake is not smooth but the underside looked much like the photo. I decided to plate ut right side up. I had to substitute measurements to grams as i’m in Australia which can change the outcome a little. This is for my Bake Group that meets tommorow and Yeast baking is the theme. I’d love to tuck into a piece now but will wait. It’ll be interesting to see how it is tomorrow. What a great recipe!!
2000498330,129257,2018-10-11,5,Amazing rice dish with fall flavors. A sweetish side to go with savory main course. Loved it.
2002297816,21761,2018-10-11,4,Pretty great!
2000268337,351469,2018-10-11,5,I actually made this recipe without the coconut milk and used 2 cups of chicken broth instead. I used Spice Island Curry powder though Madras curry is my favorite. Great basic recipe to use next time. This would make great curry tomato beef with or without the potatoes depending. Marble potatoes are wonderful in this dish.
2002298217,76003,2018-10-11,5,Love this recipe. It’s quick and easy. I add crushed pineapple to it and my boyfriend loves it.
2002297887,232767,2018-10-11,0,"I used to use a half cup of mayonnaise to mix with the soup , was always delicious"
2002298400,181143,2018-10-11,4,"It was simple to make, and tasted awesome. I tweaked it a bit, after the cream cheese was blended with everything, it was really thick so i added a half cup of milk and a bit of avocado oil to it. I also added shrimp because it felt like something was missing without some kind of meat in it. I made butter garlic shrimp so when mixed together everything is seasoned beautifully, i just added some salt and pepper after the shrimp was added."
2002298228,39087,2018-10-11,5,"I didn't notice that this recipe serves only two. Next time I'll double or triple it, even though I live alone. Portions should freeze just fine. I used 50% extra of my cajun spice because I like spicy foods. I also had some Foster Farms precooked grilled chicken breast in the freezer, and used that instead of fresh raw chicken. Prep time from start to finish was 40 minutes, less than an hour with clean up. I'll be cooking this dish frequently."
2002298196,5170,2018-10-11,5,"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I've been using this recipe for about 3 years now and EVERYONE loves them. No complaints from my very picky children or my husband. I also have made waffles using the exact same recipe and they love them as well. Topped with fruit, nutella,syrup, or even plain they eat them. Didn't change anything in the recipe."
2002142925,454403,2018-10-11,5,Turned out perfectly and love the low amount of sugar needed! I soaked the raisins in warm vanilla water while I prepared everything else they were so sweet and tender. two thumbs up
2002297695,261432,2018-10-11,5,I originally got this recipe from the actual cookbook 31 years ago. I've been making it ever since. My extra large family and I love it! I triple the recipe.
2002298522,155017,2018-10-11,5,Great weeknight dish....came excellent and was perfectly seasoned...I highly recommend!!!
2001838711,320455,2018-10-11,5,I'm no cook at all so for me this was a easy and quick meal to make after work. Thank you for sharing
2002237689,442185,2018-10-11,0,They turned out really good I put half butter and half shortening didn’t have butter flavour shortening
2002298318,350176,2018-10-11,5,I added 1/2c pure maple syrup and subbed out the milk for sour cream....
2002226732,150384,2018-10-11,5,I should have made a double batch! Followed the recipe but as a few reviewers mentioned I added 1/4 teaspoon cayenne. Just the kick it needed!
2002297826,50719,2018-10-11,5,I was out of milk so I tryed water instead.... I did a lot of baking today ran out of milk but it worked out good
1968260,240803,2018-10-11,4,"Used half&amp;half, added 2T melted butter. Cinnamon &amp; nutmeg... perfect ??"
2002298311,479113,2018-10-11,5,"Dee-lish! This did NOT make 24, due to my snitches along the way! Used my Cuisinart to process the coconut flakes and mix the rest of the ingredients in. I elected to do half frozen and half dehydrated, so will take votes from the family on which way to go next time. Very quick and easy. Definitely will make again, soon!"
2000162245,190382,2018-10-11,5,Such an excellent soup! One of our favorites in this house! I never have bay leaf so I just omitted that and served the corn on the side. Also consider adding just a few shakes of lime juice. Great with a side of cheese quesadillas to dip. Thank you so much for the recipe!
2002297842,36984,2018-10-11,5,Easy to make + family loved it. Added splash of white wine @ beginning of sautee + corn shaved off of the cob toward the end. Great taste &amp; consistency.
2000845339,362231,2018-10-11,0,I am so happy to find this recipe It is no longer on the box of lemon cake mix. Thank you for posting it.
1565704,127004,2018-10-11,0,Kittencal didn't mention the half cup water within the directions but is probably simmered with other ingredients. Or what if you wanted to use OJ and didn't have fresh orange on hand. Maybe use 1/4 cup ? Good question.
2002183553,187362,2018-10-11,5,This are amazing! My husband was so happy! Thanks
2002298233,320583,2018-10-11,5,"Hi. I’m Margaret—the person who was on Calling All Cook’s several years ago. I’m glad you like my recipe. However, whoever’s picture on the website I have a comment. Wrong bread is used. Use hard round rolls—not packaged. Make sure you pull the stuffing out and use it later for some other recipe Margaret"
2002297971,78552,2018-10-11,4,"I made this last night for my Mom. I mostly followed the recipe except I added 1/4 tsp more vanilla and reduced the salt to 3/4 tsp versus the 2 tsp called for. I used 2 8x4 loaf pans and greased with coconut oil. Following other reviewers tips, I set the oven for 325&deg;F and tented with foil at 55 minutes. They weren't cooked all the way at 70 minutes, but an extra 15 minutes did the trick. Next time, I will reduce the sugar as Mom said it'd probably still be good with just 2 cups."
172396,108231,2018-10-11,5,Hubs and my picky daughter loved it. Super easy and quick to make while kiddos were doing homework and had great flavor. Was a great diary free option for us.
2002298070,275494,2018-10-11,0,"@ Spencer 2 ~ ACTUALLY the browning with seasoned flour makes a HUGE difference!! That's where the true gravy comes from! ;) Trust me ~ my recipe (southern style beef tips) was passed down from my GREAT grandmother ?? Mine we simply brown the meat (??), then directly put in the crock pot. Add lipton beefy onion soup mix &amp; enough water to barely cover the beef tips. 4-5 hours on high &amp; VOILA!!! AMAZING ??"
305531,405472,2018-10-11,5,Yum. I made this as directed except that I added a few sliced mushrooms that I needed to use up. Simple and good. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper.
2002231645,131607,2018-10-11,0,I made this pizza dough a few times. I was very impressed how easy it rolled out and had a great flavor. Thank you
2002296887,88564,2018-10-10,0,Perfect recipe if you're looking for blacked acrid tasting brown/black rice.
2002297669,536843,2018-10-10,5,I was a little surprised to see the previous reviewer said it had no flavor. We thought it had loads of flavor. I did use Italian flavored bread crumbs instead of plain. It was very tasty and easy to prepare. This one is a keeper. Thanks!
2002297399,91827,2018-10-10,5,what are some healthy ways to make ur pizza
2002297368,124538,2018-10-10,0,you add the milk you have at home it doesnt really matter except it cant be powdered
2000050909,50719,2018-10-10,1,"Certainly NOT sweet! Actually, very bland. Disappointed"
2002296987,80647,2018-10-10,5,"This recipe was fabulous and very flavorful. I did take a previous post suggestion and used one cast iron pan. I also used beef broth made with Better Than Boullion instead of water and used thyme instead of tarragon. The dijon mustard added an amazing flavor to the meat. I didn't use aujus and just served the juices from the bottom of the pan on the side. I made creamy garlicky mashed cauliflower and green bean, shallot and mushroom medley as sides. It was delicious, the whole family loved it, even our toddler! Thank you!"
2002296915,263597,2018-10-10,5,"I've made this recipe my entire life. My mother did the same, as her mother before her. Crowd pleaser everytime. I'm making this to take to a pot luck at my school tomorrow."

2001102990,60350,2018-10-10,5,"This is an excellent basic Mac and Cheese recipe! A good sauce with the butter and if you shread your own cheese. Comfort food at it's best. Next time I will add a little dry mustard and just a pinch of cayenne for depth of flavor but it doesn't need more cheese. I do agree with other reviewers-you should stir in the cheese off the heat. It will melt quite easily and help keep the sauce smooth. Thanks for an easy, home-made recipe!"
2002297019,57679,2018-10-10,5,Perfect. Simple and easy. Used Tahitian Limes as that was all I had. Thank you for sharing
2001921182,52253,2018-10-10,4,"That's what I call noodles, not dumplings. Dumplings are fat, puffy, soft things and I use biscuit dough with extra milk and just drop them on top of hot stew, cover and cook on low for 20 minutes until done and not gooey on the bottom anymore. Chicken or beef stew, works with both, and everybody loves it."

2002099701,379637,2018-10-10,5,"I love this relish and have made it for several years. Can't believe I haven't reviewed it. It is similar to commercial hot dog relish, but lots better. Its consistency is somewhat firm and not at all runny, so it can be piled on without fear of making the bun soggy. I have found the recipe to be very forgiving, so if one doesn't care for so many onions, for example, they can be cut back. I felt it is too sweet, so I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, and,upped the spices somewhat. Of course, you can always add sugar or spices before you finish simmering. Can't remove them, though! The 8 cups of cucumbers (I prefer Kirby's) turned out to be a bit less than 4 lbs., an easier way of measuring. And chopping the veggies in my Cuisinart was a snap and provided a perfect consistency. So easy and so good! Thanks, Chill, for sharing this wonderful recipe."

2959517,194209,2018-10-10,4,My grandmother and my mom used to make these in Trinidad. I would never add the almond extract -- it changes the whole thing. Should taste of caramel and coconut.

1802737078,536575,2018-10-10,5,This recipe is excellent. I made exactly as the recipe states. My house smelled so good. It was like being in Olive Garden or Carrabba's. The recipe states it serves 4. It's really more like 6 unless you eat an awful lot.
2000676474,41318,2018-10-10,5,"I just basically made just this and then found this! I made it with pizza sauce and Italian seasoned tomato sauce I had on hand in the freezer. Both were filled quart size bags (about 7 cups total), but still wasn't enough and ended up having to add two 14 oz store bought jars of pizza sauce. We like it sloppy joe style for our open-faced pizza burgers."

Once, I wilted and chopped up half a bag of baby spinach languishing in my fridge and stirred that into the cottage cheese mixture...also very good. My family of three gets a generous dinner out of it as well as some leftovers for lunch."
2001613746,58843,2018-10-10,4,This was good. I added 4 cloves of minced garlic and the seasoning to the hot pan before adding the chicken. I separately saut&eacute;d a yellow onion and and orange and yellow bell pepper. The gyros were delicious.

2002296862,187817,2018-10-10,0,"I'm baking a chocolate cake, and raspberry filling. I thought a cream cheese frosting would be great for cake and so glad I found this recipe. So, I will be trying this and from the reviews, I don't think I'll be disappointed. :-)"
2002297268,339905,2018-10-10,3,bread is a bit to dry.. any suggestions on what i can do to fix this
2002296949,329528,2018-10-10,5,This was perfect!
2002297406,249576,2018-10-10,0,"These look tasty but what they're doing on the &quot;Health School Lunch&quot; list is beyond me. White bread, cheese, deli meats, mayo... not even close guys. Void of real nutrition."
2002276855,286419,2018-10-10,5,Fantastic soup. Something out of the ordinary. Everyone loved it!
2002173363,269713,2018-10-10,3,I filled them 3/4 full the cupcakes spread out and stuck to the top of the pan. They did not mound. I probably mixed them too long? They are delicious though.
2002296926,98934,2018-10-10,4,"This was a good base but think it would be bland and kinda dry if I hadn't added these things: to the dough I added a few tablespoons of plain kefir, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and one apple diced small. I doubled the crumble topping and added 1 tsp cinnamon. It was really good! I would probably do 2 apples next time. I had to bake mine for 16 more minutes. I think it'll be so much better once it sits overnight. Was so good with a cup of earl gray."
2000637026,39087,2018-10-10,5,"THIS IS AMAZING. It's so versatile, I also put the sauce it over rice and it was just as good. Can use fresh tomatoes as well. This is definitely one I'll be using again!"
2001449971,476306,2018-10-10,4,"It turned out pretty well despite the difficulty with the directions. I assumed the soy sauce went in with the Worcestershire sauce. And half way through the meal, it occurred to me to spread the sauce in which the chicken cooked over the chicken (as well as the beans and rice). That helped a lot. The chicken cooked 45 minutes, and that was plenty long."
2001704911,316666,2018-10-10,5,Great recipe. Used 1/2 the amount of salt.
2002296292,145312,2018-10-09,4,"This is also good with chocolate cake mix. Add 1 cup of coffee in place of water. Also, with yellow cake add cinnamon."
2795375,80963,2018-10-09,5,"After reading all the reviews, I divided the ingredients in half (except for the oil--I used 1/4 cup) and it made 11 regular sized muffins. I baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. I compared the amount of oil to other recipes, and 1/4 cup was just right. They turned out very good. Using honey and whole wheat flour creates a &quot;healthy&quot; muffin and not too sweet. Serving them with Honey Butter might please those with a sweet tooth :) I will be making these again and again. Yum!"
2002296391,325674,2018-10-09,2,it was good but i could not put the cake in the mug.
2002296053,236629,2018-10-09,5,My husband loves this recipe! I’m not the biggest fan of spam musubis- but this recipe changed my mind!
2002296376,90771,2018-10-09,5,First time making pork....I wanted a fall recipe and this was perfect! Made mashed potatoes on the side.
305531,63459,2018-10-09,5,"Somewhere in the abyss that I call my freezer.......I have some prosciutto. I couldn't find it so used some sliced ham like another reviewer did. I also used spinach fettuccine. For some reason I start craving pasta dishes in the fall and this one really hit the spot. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ev. It was easy, and good. Made for Think Pink 2018."
2001297534,16687,2018-10-09,5,I made this recipe as written. It was easy to put together and had a lot of flavor. I definitely will be making this again in the future. Thanks for sharing.
2002296687,349246,2018-10-09,5,I tried the recipie but instead of using unsweetened cocoa powder I used Hershy's chocolate milk powder and it tasted amazing
2002296027,234531,2018-10-09,5,"These are delicious, they are soft, light, and fluffy! I put melted butter and garlic salt on mine to make garlic bread to go with dinner tonight and they were yummy! :)"
2001160057,304166,2018-10-09,5,"I worked for a Greek/Lebanese restaurant, and we would make this with sour cream instead of yogurt. Really tasty!"
2002296125,100727,2018-10-09,5,I substituted 1/4 cup of honey for 1/4 of brown sugar. The cookies were perhaps the best I’ve ever made! Loved the combo of crisco and butter - who knew?!
2002292741,42780,2018-10-09,3,Several decades ago I worked at a Long John Silvers. It was a high school job and it was sloppy hard kitchen work. Among my duties was to mix the batter for the fish and chicken (it's the same). I can honestly say that the batter mix contains onion powder and paprika.
2002296041,106555,2018-10-09,0,What kind of pork roast?
2002296699,127126,2018-10-09,4,"Love this! Some of us may not be as sweet as others, so we do need to add some sugar. I add 1 tbsp to the crust and 2 tbsp to the puff topping. Note: it's very important to heat the water and butter in a pan and not in the microwave. Otherwise it doesn't have the right texture as well as it's really runny and doesn't puff up."
2002295984,97892,2018-10-09,4,"The recipe was simple and therefore decent. I had 6 slices of American Cheese which I needed to use up and therefore I looked up a recipe. I definitely needed 8, it wasn't cheesy enough. I would have given it 5 stars for an easy, kid friendly mac and cheese. Not one for an adult party. Too simple."
2002296332,12291,2018-10-09,4,Everyone really liked the end result but I did tweak it a little. I started by browning the giblets before simmering them. I also added chicken stock instead of water. Simmer time was only an hour and a half so be careful not to over cook. The meat was seriously so tender it almost didn't make it into the gravy. When it was done simmering I blended the meat with the broth but using only half the liver so it didn't taste so &quot;organ-y&quot;. After blending I put it into the fridge to cool. When the Turkey was done I removed the juices and fat from the roasting pan. I then put my pan on the stove top and used the fat from the bird to make a roux(flour/fat mixture) directly in the roasting pan. When the roux was ready I added my blended mixture along with the juice from the bird. It was rather thick so I used some water that the vegetables were boiled in to thin it out. So very tasty.
2002296535,294152,2018-10-09,5,"These Cabbage Rolls were delicious that even a meat eater would enjoy it. I did make a few adaptations to the recipe. I used the Yves Veggie Ground Crumble. I'm normally weary of the meat subs as they tend to have an acquired taste but I could barely taste it! I added a lot of garlic about 6 cloves, roughly chopped. I then added 1/3 cup of BBQ sauce. Then I used the juice of two limes, one in the sauce and the other in the filling. It was well needed as it added a lot of brightness to the dish! For the sauce I used Aylmer's Diced Tomatoes in Garlic and Olive Oil and the Black Pepper one instead, and 1/4 cup of Clamato Juice, plus a bit of brown sugar. It was a hit, I ended up with about 12 cabbage rolls altogether with a little extra filling. I will definitely remake again!"
2002296760,216115,2018-10-09,0,It came out gd to be first time I made it..that even my friend loved/liked it..that she asked me 4 the recipe. .Lol..but as Hispanic I am! We need always an avocado when it comes to rice recipe ...hope you all like it????
2000333191,264995,2018-10-09,0,Is there any way this can be put on Pinterest?
2002295999,397238,2018-10-09,2,Did not like the nutmeg. Apples almost complete mush from the water. Odd consistency in the crisp. Will probably throw out.
2002296669,282620,2018-10-09,5,Ever since i found this I've made it a lot. The only thing i do different is i add onions. I love this recipe. It's fast and easy.
63128,27000,2018-10-09,5,"I made this for a church event yesterday and it was a hit! The only changes I made were to use my own apple pie filling (actually leftovers of a phyllo apple pie I made the previous day) and pecans with caramel sauce (from Trader Joe's) rather than walnuts and cinnamon...oh, and I put them on before baking rather than after. (I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients and some were at or beyond their expiration date - I tasted them before using ??)"
2002296757,484218,2018-10-09,0,I am SOOOO excited to find this! Our grinder and sausage attachments for the kitchenaid arrived today! I know what we’re doing this weekend! Thanks!!!!
1179225,350089,2018-10-09,4,Great way to satisfy a pizza craving quick! Thank for sharing the recipe.
2002296728,60350,2018-10-09,4,"Followed recipe exactly, except added about 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese after mixing in the cheddar. It gives it a little extra zing!"
2002296722,223561,2018-10-09,5,"The hardest part was cutting the butternut squash. After I added the Half &amp; Half, I loved the consistency, so I didn’t add any water. Used fresh small ravioli. My husband said I can make this any time!"
2002296353,122878,2018-10-09,4,turned out great so far. I'm a diabetic can't eat the ice cream.
2002296451,79506,2018-10-09,5,I took the advice about tempering the gelitan and it fixed me problem with it getting globby stuff in it. Thank you for that tip.
126440,299987,2018-10-09,5,Great black bean cakes! Best I've made. Served with Mexican Kale Salad. Will make many times again.
2002296175,414864,2018-10-09,0,"I made this brown sugar butter crust today for a fresh pineapple cheesecake.I love brown sugar (dark) and often swap out white sugar for brown. This crust was delicious.I may have found it on another site or misread the butter measurement. Later I thought that the next time I used it, I would increase the amount of butter I used, 8 Tbls. (One stick), just a smidge. When I read the reciepe later and made better use of my bifocals, I see the butter amount was more...by 1 1/2 Tbls.!An amount that counts as a &quot;smidge&quot; in my world. I had some fresh pineapple that was almost passed it's expiration and 8 oz of cream cheese, so like it or not, that was the combination. It was delicious, a great pairing of flavors. I don't really care for canned pineapple and don't care for the texture. So I threw it into the Ninja to pulverize! I was pressed for time and not everyone likes shredded coconut, so I just dusted with powdered sugar. Would still like to find a unique topping. So, this use of brown sugar in the traditional world of white sugar defiantly deserves a 5 Star rating!"
2002296322,133018,2018-10-09,0,It was awesome. I used 5T honey 6T sweet cream unsalted butter 1T real Maple syrup and 3C 12 grain cereal from bulkfoods.com
169430,307723,2018-10-09,5,"Made this using steelhead trout and will admit that I was just a tad bit unsure of the sour cream. There was no need to be as it came out marvelous. Lovely flavors that play very nicely together. If fact, I would happily serve this to guests. Used Panko crumbs and they worked well. Thanks Lynn for another way to serve fish."
2002296053,401126,2018-10-09,5,My family loved these! I just made some and I was so excited to try them that I forgot to take a Picture! Loved the recipe- we ate every single taco!
2002296750,34657,2018-10-09,1,"I was less than impressed. It looked good, but was very thick, and didn't cook properly. I did a test run on just a couple of small pieces of fish, it went soggy very quickly. Even after playing with the recipe, and adding more beer to get it the right consistency, I quickly decided I wouldn't make this beer batter again. ??"
2054282,329804,2018-10-09,5,"Yum. Easy - better than the syrups you buy. The recipe is for a sweet milk-chocolate version (typical kid fair). And it is exactly that. The second time I made the recipe I doubled the cocoa, and that version is a darker, deeper chocolate flavor (more to my family's taste). But both versions are winners. Bonus: Boil the syrup until it is really thick and you have a perfect hot chocolate sauce for desserts."
2002296380,171225,2018-10-09,5,"It's not &quot;Chicago style&quot; it's better! Disappointed with other recipes I decided to give this one a try. While I was a little uncertain about the yeast activation method, and found myself questioning the cornmeal and olive oil... It came out perfect, this will be my go to recipe in the future. *notes 1) As suggested, I mixed the dough with a wooden spoon 2) Recipe made the perfect amount for two, 10&quot; cast iron skillet pies"
1832710,386066,2018-10-09,5,"Delicious! I was a little surprised the veggies were not to be saut&eacute;ed but once every mixed with the sauce, it was super tasty! The flavors were super-bold and everyone gobbled it up. Quick, easy and tasty!"
2002293648,531396,2018-10-09,0,"Turned out kinda bland, turns out we didn't add the pepper because it wasn't mentioned in the directions, whoops!"
2000498330,306673,2018-10-09,5,Nice change from my regular pork chops and rice. Loved the orange flavor. I sprinkled a little salt and pepper over the rice. Delicious simple weeknight meal.
227978,424001,2018-10-09,5,"Oh my, these were fantastic sandwiches. I made them for lunch, and kept them sandwich size so my kids would eat them. I didn't make any changes, but for the options I used cream cheese (instead of butter), for the seafood I used shrimp, and for the bread I used 12-grain bread. Everything else was exactly as written. The seafood mix is wonderful, and I really enjoyed the touch of horseradish as it added a lovely zest to the mix. I really enjoyed these. Thanks, Lavender Lynn. Make for Thing Pink 2018"
2002295983,159273,2018-10-09,5,"Had some overripe bananas, so whipped this up this morning. It was easy and delicious. A couple of small changes -half the flour was whole wheat, cut down sugar to just under a cup, added fresh, fat blueberries! Perfect!"
2002296067,55045,2018-10-09,0,"I had lots of leftover supplies, so I decided to try making s'mores in the microwave. They came out so well, I wondered if others were doing the same thing. This recipe is exactly what I was doing, with one small change."
2002296812,335392,2018-10-09,2,Very thin and not how I expected it to turn out
2002296444,309030,2018-10-09,1,10 Points (using recipe builder) with new WW app (2018)- hardly a good choice
2002296047,286419,2018-10-09,5,This was 5 stars YUMMY! My husband loved it and so did I. I love one pot soups and this one is bursting with flavor. I used chicken broth and chicken bone broth for enhanced taste. We'll be making it frequently. Thanks for sharing.
2002296201,153642,2018-10-09,5,great recipe - simple and delicious. I overbaked them slightly so keep an eye out. Still very good though. I tried them with a little cinnamon and cardamom - but found it overshadowed the simple flavors so I vote no on the additions. Thanks.
2002296018,372087,2018-10-09,4,"If you follow the recipe and refrigerate the dough, I think they come out just fine. Mine didn't fall apart and held shape very well. I think this is a cookie that does need a beverage to wash it down though."
2002289730,484135,2018-10-09,0,We always put this in a Bundt pan. So pretty. I haven't made it in years. Will give it a go this fall.
1832710,131639,2018-10-09,4,"I used the last tomatoes from my garden and followed the recipe exactly. It was a little tart but still delicious. Perhaps I could have roasted the tomatoes a little longer or used smaller, sweeter ones."
2000333191,458843,2018-10-09,0,Is there any way that this recipe can be put on Pinterest?
2002296145,240822,2018-10-09,5,"Absolutely delicious recipe!!!! I didn’t have raisins on hand so that’s the only thing I left out. I also forgot to strain the tomatoes so I ended up straining the whole thing at the end and it was so smooth and pretty looking. Definitely spicy ?? so if you are sensitive to heat maybe add half the ancho chiles it says. The depth of flavor in this is incredible, and it’s soooo yummy with the chicken!! It’s super hard work the first time doing it but it’s totally worth it!"
91970,536859,2018-10-09,5,"I made this over the weekend and it is delicious! The only change that I made was to omit the pepper flakes. I used a variety of hot peppers instead and added a splash of balsamic vinegar (just because) . It has just the right amount of heat for my liking. This was my first time making jelly so, I did appreciate having the video to check with. Thanks so much for sharing."
207478,246912,2018-10-08,5,This was wonderful. I haven't liked cilantro before but this didn't taste soapy at all. All the flavors complimented each other and were wonderful. Thank you.
2001706031,28943,2018-10-08,4,"This is a nice easy pastry recipe to put together. I have a very good recipe that makes 4 crusts but I needed one for only 2 and this will be my go-to for 2 for sure. I did have to use an extra tablespoon of water which I think is in part due to the fact that I live in a very dry climate. I let it rest for at least a couple hours before rolling it out and it rolled out easily. I also basted the crust with an egg/mild wash prior to putting in the apple filling I was using, this seals the crust from the inside and ensures that it bakes through and doesn't come out soggy. I used this pastry for a slab pie so baked it for 45 min or so @ 375 .. tu"
2001804529,207398,2018-10-08,5,Turned out to be the best I've ever made. So they say..
2002295855,69360,2018-10-08,5,Added blueberries and pecans also and cooked an additional 5 min until browned
2002295799,92633,2018-10-08,0,I tried and my Jung hard as a mugg
2002295504,426791,2018-10-08,5,"I made some deep fried chicken with this recipe and everyone who had it really enjoyed it. thank you so much for the recipe, it was very helpful."
2002295133,115208,2018-10-08,5,google &quot;peppers&quot; or &quot;chili pepper&quot;...there are hundreds... crock pot pork yummm!
2002295352,152519,2018-10-08,0,"Next time I bake these muffins I won't bake them for a full 20 minutes because they were quite dry. I think I will also use less flour, as the batter was too thick, or maybe more sweet potato/milk."
2002295958,99750,2018-10-08,5,"These have always been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. Some like them with cheese, some with a spicy mustard. There has been talk about getting fancy and using french bread and course chopped sirloin with a horseradish cream, but we are too busy eating the original recipe."
2001563787,20826,2018-10-08,5,I have been making this for years from the BH&amp;G magazine. I couldn't find my copy and stumbled onto yours here. This dish is packed with flavor while being diet friendly. Thanks for sharing!!!!
2002295118,435234,2018-10-08,0,"Simple easy recipe I did myself is just one box of large elbow mac heavily salted, 2 squeeze packs of Velveeta, 4 slices of Wisconsin white cheddar, 1 6 oz bag of shredded Parmesan, 1 8 oz bag of shredded sharp cheddar, half a stick of butter, and some milk to consistency and it is the best ever! Hint dont rinse your pasta it will thicken from the starch without adding flour."
2002294989,459431,2018-10-08,4,Has a really good taste. I loved it. Husband said was too spicy so you should probably adjust the cayenne if you don't like spicy. I didn't have taco seasoning so I used fajita seasoning instead. I had a problem with the cook time though. After 20 minutes on med low the rice was rock hard &amp; most of the water was still there. I kept adding 5 more minutes then stirring. After 50 minutes I increased the temperature from 2.5 to 3.5. After 55 minutes I increased it to 6. After 60 mins I increased it to 7.5 and removed the lid. Stirring constantly for 10 more mins finally most of the water was absorbed &amp; rice was tender. I used both Velveeta &amp; shredded Mexican blend cheese. I just stirred it in with the other ingredients. I didn't have corn chips but I put it on a corn tortilla with sour cream. Then gobbled it up. Yummmm
2002295739,162532,2018-10-08,5,Tasted just like the real thing!
2002200783,311528,2018-10-08,5,I made this tonight and it was delicious!!! I grew up in eastern NC and this was perfect!!!
2002295920,26039,2018-10-08,1,This was awful. It was WAY too garlicky and didnt taste like Papa John's at all.
2002295123,482681,2018-10-08,5,"I made these for our Thanksgiving dinner today because I have an abundance of rather nice carrots and did not want to get too creative as we were going to be eating a lot of turkey and stuffing! I did forget the lemon juice, but they were an awesome way to eat carrots! I sliced each good sized carrot lengthwise and again and then into about 1/4s and boiled with some kosher salt until tender crisp. A bit of butter, brown sugar and honey and WOW! They were a hit with every dinner guest. I will make them again!"
2001343439,90783,2018-10-08,5,I doubled this recipe and froze the rest. Great recipe!!! Wonderful comfort food!! The best piggys I've ever made... My husband is also a fan!! Thank you!!!
2002295151,220082,2018-10-08,4,"Loved this recipe! Tender and moist, i reduced the sugar by half a cup and still found it a little sweet, would probably just go with 3/4 cups of sugar next time! Made a lovely Victoria Sandwich with Bonne Maman strawberry preserve (its the best for cake fillings!), perfect for tea!"
2002001939,80408,2018-10-08,5,Made this today in the Crock-Pot. It turned out to be outstanding! I substituted 1/4 cup tomato paste for the 1/2 cup tomato sauce because that's what I had on hand. And I waited till the very end to make the roux. I basically put everything together in the Crock-Pot on low for 8 hours EXCEPT the oil and flour. Right before we were ready to eat I made the roux in a medium sized pot and then added everything from the crock pot into it stirring gently. It thickened up perfectly and tasted amazing.
2002151711,80470,2018-10-08,1,"I’m really surprised with the amount of excellent reviews. I have had nothing but great success with Genius Kitchen and never failed with a recipe till this one. Nothing is necessarily wrong, it’s just a weird recipe. I’ve tried 3 times. Once with the original, and then different tweaks the other two times that supposedly were the most “successful.” The bottoms browned, but the tops wouldn’t. The bottom is a brown disk with a pale white top, and I couldn’t melt the chocolate chips without burning the bottoms. Ontop of which, this cookie has zero flavor. It just tastes like a mouthful of chocolate chips. I don’t get it."
2002295019,99966,2018-10-08,5,"By FAR the best roll recipe I have ever made, or eaten for that matter. Everyone raves over them! Thanks for the recipe Paula!"
2002295968,226105,2018-10-08,5,"Easy, straight-forward and delicious. Thanks!"

1530765,338883,2018-10-08,0,The secret to a real good cream gravy is a pinch of nutmeg.
400708,472623,2018-10-08,5,"This has to be the BEST ice cream ever, specially if you enjoy coffee flavor and we sure do, creamy, rich, chocolaty mocha goodness for sure. I did make 2 tweaks, used all heavy cream, and instead of orea cookies, used mini chocolate chips - the best!!!"
2002281598,69086,2018-10-08,0,"If you change the recipe, you can't say the one posted was &quot;delicious&quot; because it's not the same recipe. Just sayin'."
2001278358,92021,2018-10-08,5,"Good flavor to the everyday hamburger. I shaped my harmburger for eight slider buns. For the mixing, I used only 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and added a teaspoon of oregano (as the add-on). The meat is quite wet in the bowl, so there was onion left."
2002295620,217493,2018-10-08,4,"Turned out fabulous! Flavor is excellent, density is heavy. I also added 1t of vanilla bean paste, and 1c of chocolate chips so my children would eat them. They didn't last long! I'm going to try adding an egg next time, and I would like to see how this works in loaf form."
2002086536,52272,2018-10-08,5,I made this as directed and it was the best homemade clam chowder I've had. It tasted like a high end restaurant clam chowder!
2002295836,273987,2018-10-08,1,"I hate most icings, and I love whipping cream on my cakes. I remembered some sort of whipping cream icing, and this definitely wasn’t it. My friend and I are purely disgusted and I don’t recommend it. Tastes funny and unnaturally gross."
2001872993,217082,2018-10-08,5,Getting ready to start making these and hope they freeze well! Made them last Christmas for my hubby who recalled his grandmother's being oh so good. These were a huge hit!
2002295676,8845,2018-10-08,5,"I didn't have enough bananas so I added about a cup of pureed pumpkin, replaced 1/2 granulated sugar with brown sugar and used pecans instead of walnuts because I was out. Moist and delish. Might not be sweet enough for everyone's taste, but will be perfect warmed, with a little butter. Will definitely make again."
2002294957,260781,2018-10-08,5,"Very easy recipe, no tweaks and the taste is great. My family loves these pumpkin muffins eventhough they are not pumpkin flavored fans."
2002295619,256449,2018-10-08,5,"I have to admit that I’m not the most expert cook or baker in the kitchen but knowing that husband die for sweet things I decided to try this new easy recipe and it turns so good . I did some modifications to the original recipe because I didn’t have 14 oz of evaporated milk neither 28 oz of peaches , so I did half of the ingredients and it work perfect with a little more the time in the oven until it was bubbling nicely. I definitely recommend it. It’s yummy, smells so good and tastes like heaven ( I never have been there but I can imagine) thanks again."
2002295757,69173,2018-10-08,5,"These meatballs turned out delicious. Do not let the simplicity of the recipe fool you. They taste better than I thought they would. I followed recipe as written with the exception of milk. I only had heavy cream. Since I used grass-fed beef which tends to be lean, I think the extra fat was a good thing?"
2002295174,478379,2018-10-08,4,"Excellent recipe! Mixed vegetable oil s: 3/4 avocado oil &amp; 1/4 coconut oil. Used two different baking pans: 1. Professional baking sheet 2. Aluminum tin (throw away) baking sheet. Used two different kinds of oils on the pans: 1. Olive oil 2. Coconut oil. Made two sizes - small &amp; large. Tested - All successful /Taste, Texture. Next time will decrease amount of sugar. 4 starts because we prefer less sweet. However, great alternative for margarine. Enjoy!!"
2951872,438883,2018-10-08,5,Absolutely love this soup! I’ve been making this recipe for a few years now. I use Rice A Roni Long Grain and Wild Rice. I cut down on the fat by reducing butter to 1 stick and I don’t use the cream. I’ve used 1% milk and also milk and evaporated milk. It’s plenty creamy for me! Oh and I also add more rice. I use regular rice and it cooks up fine. You could use Minute Rice if you want. I use thighs usual instead of breasts. . Love ?? it when it starts to cool down so I can make this. Today was finally the day!
2001956411,156767,2018-10-08,5,This dish is a keeper! I have made it several times and it will be one of my “go to’s” for years to come.
2001878269,423823,2018-10-08,5,Loved it just as written!!! Thanks for the recipe!
2002294602,130268,2018-10-08,3,Just ok. Not sure flavorful. We added some sour cream and quite a bit of salt and pepper for added taste. Decent and good ingredients but nothing too special.
2002295549,225283,2018-10-08,5,This was my first try and they came out great. Thank You
2000659458,154224,2018-10-08,5,"Made this for my honey and his friend. They crushed it. I mixed the raviolis in the sauce before spreading in pan, otherwise made it just like the recipe. Next time I may try spinach and cheese ravioli for something different. They LOVED it as it was and I will add this to my rotation of meals! Super fast and easy."
1803179828,531171,2018-10-08,4,"I really enjoyed added diced ham or cooked bacon. With all quiches you can add just about anything, try few spoonfuls of cottage cheese."
2002295552,289559,2018-10-08,5,"My vegetarian girlfriend gave me access to the kitchen for the night, so I used this TVP recipe to make us taco salads. We were both impressed and had enough leftovers for nachos a couple of days later for football. New to TVP? This is a great start!"
2000039750,141819,2018-10-08,0,"This is black beans with rice, not moros. In moros and congri the beans and rice are cooked together not separately."

2002295706,64860,2018-10-08,5,"I'm far from pretentious, but I love good pizza. If you are having difficulty with this recipe, I'd suggest that the consistency is key, so measure carefully (like a baker.) Too much flour, a bit too much salt, not enough water or yeast, and you will end with a brick of glue. As with most baked goods, measure precisely and you will be amazed at the difference in the results. SIFT, SIFT, SIFT your flour. I don't sift flour for much because I generally don't bake, but with pancakes and pizza dough (the two flour-based recipes I use) I only get a consistent result when I measure consistently. Some comments below reference needing a bit more water, or having a dry crusty mess. Next time you try this recipe, measure 3.5 cups of (unsifted) flour and then sift it and measure again, you'll have 4+ cups of flour, which is not what you want in this! This is a great recipe for a good universal pizza dough. YMMV - I prefer to roll 4x 15&quot; diameter pizzas out of one batch. This is quite thin crust, but crispy like a cracker when cooked on a 550 degree pre-heated pizza stone. I've also taken this very same recipe and made the whole batch into a single Chicago-style deep dish. After pressing into a deep dish pan, I put slices of mozzarella on top of the dough to keep the liquids in the ingredients (tomatoes and mushrooms from making everything soggy."
2002119545,343216,2018-10-08,0,I'm glad I reviewed the comments ahead of time I have it a little extra salt to my batter too
2002294924,411042,2018-10-08,5,I made this with wheat flour and used 6 mini foil pans instead of loaf pans. Came out perfect! Thanks for the recipe; this will be my go-to going forward.
2002295807,107786,2018-10-08,5,What’s a good side that would go with these yummy ribs?
305531,321548,2018-10-08,5,"Yum. I really enjoyed this dish. I used spinach fettuccine and really liked the red pepper flakes to add a little more flavor and bite. Thanks for sharing this nice keeper, Kathy."
400708,439392,2018-10-08,5,"Breezermom, can't tell you how much we enjoyed these, I made the for DH's birthday appy and I got rave reviews all evening. From the taste of the fritters to the amazing dipping sauce, everyone wanted the recipes. I made as directed except added a scant 1/2 teaspoon of pepper flakes to the fritter mix as DH loves the bite of them. The real star of this recipe as good as the fritters where is that dipping sauce - I'll be keeping that on hand for so much. I must say when I looked at the fritter mix in the bowl, I didn't know if it would work as it was so loose - but not to worry, it was perfect as they began to fry in the free form shapes. Love it all"
198154,14577,2018-10-08,4,"I made these using 3 large portobello caps. They had very short steams. So I just chopped them and added them to the spinach and cheese mixture. I diced grape tomatoes from the garden and sprinkled with garlic salt, omitting the regular salt. They were so good. DH isn't a fan of spinach, so he said he'd prefer if I cut back on it next time. But, all in all, these were a hit."
2002295554,35475,2018-10-08,5,Simple to make yet so delicious and moist. Best date loaf ever!!! My new GO TO RECEIPE.
2002295081,512030,2018-10-08,0,"I used an extra teaspoon of butter. I was making a ham based gravy so I used &quot;Better Than Bouillon&quot; ham. I mixed the stock per directions on the jar of bouillon. I used a little less flower because I've used this recipe before to make chicken gravy and it was too thick for my liking. Onice I combined the flower and butter I added an ADDITIONAL TABLESPOON (roughly, maybe a little more )of the bouillon. I poured in 2 cups of the broth I made and it is DELICIOUS!"
2002294747,518670,2018-10-07,5,"Added a little extra garlic. Topped with Easy Keto Marinara Sauce, diced onion, chopped fresh mushroom, chopped spinach, banana pepper rings, cooked sausage and bacon. Sprinkled a little extra cheese on toppings. Sprayed a little canola spray on top to moisten spinach and mushrooms. Turned out excellent!"
2301153,17226,2018-10-07,4,it said &quot;2&quot; Tablespoons garlic powder.
2002294350,336209,2018-10-07,3,"I found it over all very tasty, however, the teaspoon of cayenne pepper is way too much for me. After all was said and done, I added another can of cream of mushroom soup which was enough to balance it for me."
2002294060,183399,2018-10-07,5,"I made this for lunch for a friend and it was the best batter for fish we had ever had! Instead of chips, because the batter was so darn good, we made onion rings. We did add a tsp of cumin and 1/4 tsp each of cayenne and smoked paprika,for the onion rings. So good. The rings were still crispy when reheated! Thank you for sharing your moms recipe!"
2001843672,357440,2018-10-07,4,I didn’t have white wine so I used more chicken broth. My pork chops were thick and took a little bit longer to cook but they were good.
2001607882,133751,2018-10-07,5,My family loves this sauce! I always double the recipe for teriyaki chicken and rice (with broccoli). I have made it over ten times now and always turns out great. It is the perfect teriyaki sauce. The only thing I change is that I use minced garlic (at least a teaspoon full) because I never keep garlic powder in my seasonings cabinet.
2002294325,30787,2018-10-07,0,I used to have a recipe about 40 years ago. Lost the recipe but have dried apricots and need to try this one! Thank you!
1586025,21761,2018-10-07,0,terrible the sprouts burned before they were cooked etc etc there was no flavour awful
2002294684,317045,2018-10-07,4,juicy and good flavor.
2002294600,50379,2018-10-07,5,"Great 'basic' recipe. I added lots for additional flavour. I'm gluten free so I used King Arthur Flour One to One and it worked great. I was also a tad shy of one cup of buttermilk so I added 2 tablespoons of yoghurt. In addition, I used 2 jalapenos, also added about a cup of chopped cilantro, a cup of fine diced green onions, a tea. of cumin and a tea. of chipotle powder and a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes. Because of the additional ingredients, I used 2 eggs, not one. I also bumped the cheese to 1/2 cup and sprinkled some on top prior to baking. Yum, yum. My husband said he really couldn't taste the jalapenos so next time I'll use habaneros instead. Lovely texture, great looking. I would make this again in a heartbeat.....with habaneros!"
2002275568,83203,2018-10-07,5,"This was so moist and flavorful, but not salty as I was afraid of with the amount of soy sauce. I used toasted sesame oil and it was so much more flavorful than using olive oil. I didn't find it oily at all. First time I marinated it for 4 hours. Next time I marinated it overnight - so much juicier and moist! I used twice the amount of ginger and added a bit of brown sugar with 2 Tbsp honey. A keeper!!!"
2002293875,255218,2018-10-07,0,I made it With Splenda and added fresh chopped cranberries instead of raisins or Craisins.
2002294365,20751,2018-10-07,5,Best batch ever! Love the tomato sauce mixed in with the meat. We will use a little less rice next time. Amazing full flavor!!
2001338520,184288,2018-10-07,5,I made this in August at the height of peach season here. I maintain that it was too easy to make to be as good as it was! Made as written. Deliciously fresh with crunch. A perfect summer dessert!
2002293984,82778,2018-10-07,4,I used less butter and 8 oz light cream cheese instead of sour cream. I also used fat free half n half. Was done in 3 hours on low. Used blender to make it smoother. I recommend only 3 cups liquid And I used vegetarian broth instead of water. Good tasting soup!
2002294638,219321,2018-10-07,0,Made this dish for dinner last night. Substituted red potatoes in place of the mushrooms and wine instead of beer and it turned out delicious. It was equal to lamb shanks that I ordered at a very upscale restaurant!
2002293912,23935,2018-10-07,5,"These are delicious! Followed the doubling instructions, reducing sugar in topping as suggested (i.e., 1/2 cup in basic recipe became 1 cup in doubled recipe) and result was perfect. Just sweet enough, but not cloying. Used finely shredded organic coconut in topping with good results. Lined pan with parchment paper to facilitate removal of cut bars from pan. They were a hit at our bonsai meeting!"
2002293904,109287,2018-10-07,5,Tweaked it a bit. Added a bit more oats and less flour. More cinnamon too. It was delicious!
2002294845,429438,2018-10-07,0,"You geniuses DO realize you're doubling ingredients. Almost every ingredient you add,is also already in French Dressing."
2002294362,228854,2018-10-07,4,"I used a teaspoon of sugar where it called for tablespoon, plenty sweet. Half teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes and a teaspoon of sesame oil in the stir fry sauce. I added two cloves of garlic minced and a minced chunk of fresh ginger added to the pan after the stir frying of the meat was finished. I added a half julienned green and red bell pepper, and half an onion julienned. The marinade stuck sverely to the pan but all in all the results were very good."
2002291951,123111,2018-10-07,0,"This is an awesome recipe, it turned out so well. The syrup has a delicious taste and great consistency. And the candy is delicious as well. I too will never buy candied ginger again! Thanx for the fantastic recipe! Katrina"
2001760263,22782,2018-10-07,5,"Stop right here, and NEVER make another spaghetti sauce recipe. I love to cook and have tried a lot of them- this is by far the best! I tried the recipe 3 ways because I had a lot of garden tomatoes to use and it's the end of the 2018 growing season. See below for tips you might want to use on this recipe: 1. Original recipe, except: - I used tomatoes from the garden, so I had to add an extra tsp of salt because of course they weren't canned). - Used 1lb mild and 1lb hot Italian sausage. - I also added 1TB balsmic vinegar and for the wine, used &quot;Layer Cake&quot; Cabernet Sauvignon. AWESOME!! 2. Recipe #2: - Used 1lb mild Italian sausage and 1lb Italian Wine and Cheese sausage (which I make myself, you can google it in the internet- very easy to make your own :) - Used canned fire roasted tomatoes from the store - Added the same wine and balsamic vinegar as aobe. (I'd vote this the best version, although they all turned out great!) 3, Recipe #3: - Used 2lb mild Italian sausage - Used remaining garden tomatoes, so I had 2 add the extra tsp salt. - Added the same wine and balsamic vinegar as the above recipes. This recipe is awesome!!! Just say yes!"
2002293492,219978,2018-10-07,0,"Please !!! Forget the Foil !! Never let aluminum foil touch your food. I cook my sausages in a bit of water first to start them cooking through, and then uncover and let the water evaporate and the sausages brown. Layer in a roasting pan with onions and peppers (and garlic cloves) with fennel seed, red pepper flakes, oregano and thyme. Cover and roast for an hour covered (with foil - yes - but not touching the food) and another hour uncovered to caramelize (stirring a few times) This is easy and so good !! Thanks for sharing another great recipe !!"
2002294530,178446,2018-10-07,5,"I did add a little more salt,an oregano.It was perfecto..I mixed it with pork an deer meat ground together..MMM MMMM Goood"
2001739627,314869,2018-10-07,5,Made these with Cinnamon Sugar! Turned out great!! :)

2002293944,282073,2018-10-07,5,"Wow, this turned out great!"
2002208175,45006,2018-10-07,5,Loved Ryan's suggestion. Using the pizza cutter to cut them made them a lot more soft. Otherwise this is a great recipe the whole family loves
2002294057,202281,2018-10-07,5,Best tacos I've ever had
2123645,218584,2018-10-07,5,"This is so good! Like a pumpkin pie with a crumble on top. I ended up baking this close to 1 hour and 20 minutes to get it to be brown on top. In addition to the cinnamon, I added 1 teaspoon ginger and 1/2 teaspoon cloves. Delicious!"
2002208175,2886,2018-10-07,5,This is the best bannana bread I have ever made. Love it. The kids also like it when we make muffins out of it. 23 minutes and they come out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe
2002294312,327682,2018-10-07,0,"Hi Cindy, I'm about to embark on my first attempt to make apple butter. I want to say this looks like the recipe I am going to use, although I must point out that you can NOT use paraffin to seal jars. It is not a safe method for preserving canned foods. Please check into this and remove it from your post."
2002294007,376845,2018-10-07,5,Fantastic! Thanks for sharing! This is definitely going into our rotation. Think it would be good with a bit of orange. Served with frozen stir-fry veggies and basmati rice.
2002294342,36984,2018-10-07,5,"I have made this recipe several times! Excellent!!!!!! The modifications I've made is that I add a soy sauce and little molasses to the stock. Also, I add fresh cut green beans and frozen sweet peas toward the end of simmering. I have received many compliments! Thank you for the BEST stew recipe EVER!"
2001231867,249816,2018-10-07,5,"If you have leftovers, stuff some bell peppers with it, bake and enjoy."
2001935821,169019,2018-10-07,5,"I have never made Cincinnati Chili until today. My husband mentioned it a few months ago so I wanted to make it. I had read all of the reviews before I tackled this recipe. Some mentioned that the cloves and cinnamon are too strong. I use cinnamon sticks in the ubiquitous Vietnamese noodles, pho. Cinnamon powder is put in a cloth spice bag and discard when done. So I put in 2 2&quot; cinnamon sticks and 1 T of whole cloves in a spice bag. You can wrap the cloves in a coffee filter, wrap completely and tie in kitchen twine. Since I grind my own beef, I simply slide the freshly ground meat into the boiling water, stir with a wooden spoon. Or like someone suggested, use the stick blender to break up the meat. I skipped the onion since quite a few folks from Cincinnati said onion is a &quot;way&quot;, not in the chili itself. I used 1 1/2 Tablespoons of raw cacao powder and 1/2 T of butter instead of the 1/2 oz. unsweetened chocolate. I used the same measurement for the rest of the ingredients. Once done, discard the clove bag and cinnamon sticks. My husband loved it with raw chopped onion and shredded cheddar cheese. He said it is a keeper."
2002294332,295761,2018-10-07,4,Very easy recipe (had everything already in pantry) kept it just as it was and added EnjoyLife chocolate chips (dairy allergy kid) I was tempted to add vanilla or something to it but glad I didn’t. It came out like a biscuit/muffin. Kids put Earth Balance vegan butter on them and ate them up.
226867,379516,2018-10-07,4,"Flavor was great, but I forgot to put in the lettuce, so I unrolled the tortilla to stick in the lettuce and that didn't work too well! I'll pay more attention next time!! See... Made for Think Pink"
2002293940,11345,2018-10-07,5,Twice I've made these. I can't figure out what happened with the negative reviews. Perhaps they were expecting a different batter texture? I assumed since these were made with oil and were dropped in the pan instead of cut and shaped that the dough wasnt going to be very thick. And I was right. I even got nervous and was prepared to add extra flour if my first batch ended up running too much. But it was fine. Perfectly fine. I didn't tweak anything. I did cut the recipe in half the second time around. Still came out fine. I throw brown sugar on top before I bake them. I make them extra sweet. Oh. Guess I did tweak them. I added extra sugar. But you don't need to if you plan on frosting them.
2002294082,431399,2018-10-07,2,It was not good it came out a sweet omelette
2002294053,177572,2018-10-07,5,Its a great recipe. Very good vindaloo.
198154,74821,2018-10-07,4,"I have to admit, I didn't use exact measurements for some ingredients. I used what I had on hand. I used the whole package of sausage, more than double the garlic, a large red pepper and part of a green, a whole onion and half a produce bag of kale from my farm share. I also had to use gluten free Barilla spaghetti due to a family member with gluten intolerance. Some family members added additional Parmesan and one got out the garlic pepper seasoning grinder to give theirs more flavor. But, we all enjoyed it!"
2001885895,217322,2018-10-07,4,"I really loved it, and so simple too. I followed the recipe and didn't change a thing. It's a different kind of mac and cheese, not your average. The flavor is awesome and I made a pig of myself LOL If you like fontina and Gorgonzola cheese you'll love this !!"
2002294485,339453,2018-10-07,5,"I used my electric roaster last year and will use again this year! I used butter, fresh sage &amp; thyme under the breast skin and rubbed olive oil all over the bird, I can't believe how brown our Turkey was the skin was crispy and delicious!! I made my gravy the day before and then added all the juices from the roasted Turkey day of, so easy"
2002267737,69173,2018-10-07,5,"My husband and teenage son LOVED these (and so did I). All of the reviews here are true. They have the right ratio of milk/parm/meat or something....they are delicious. I gave them a sear in a pan before adding them to the sauce to let them finish out their cooking (checked with eat thermometer when done - about 25 min). Next time I think I'll try baking them before adding them to the sauce, only because we like a bit of a crusty meatball. I know, I know, they taste so much better cooked in the sauce :) This is definitely my go-to-recipe for meatballs from here on in."
2001543318,123316,2018-10-07,5,"Thank goodness that someone understands that real Texas Chili does not, repeat, does not have beans. However, it is seldom made from ground meats or sausages. Real Texas Chili is made with chunks of beef, slow simmered until fall apart tender in a variety of chilies and other spices. This is close, but the texture will not be Real Texas Chili"
2002293833,23854,2018-10-07,1,"How did these get 5 star reviews and come up first on a Google search?! They are horrible, super dry and come out white, without a hint of golden brown. It's bizarre to have a baking recipe devoid of any oil or butter. Would NOT recommend!"
2002294826,321689,2018-10-07,5,Fantastic! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Definitely a family favorite!
1310187,489916,2018-10-07,2,"Maybe my candy melts were old or defective. I couldn't get them to melt to the point of being able to &quot;dunk&quot; the cookies. I had to use a spoon and spread it on. Coated them halfway because I was too discouraged to use the white melts for faces so just dotted eyes on with black decorating gel. Baby shower tomorrow, too late for do over."
2002200210,123316,2018-10-07,4,"Actually, this IS authentic Texas chili, not that there’s only one. Tell tale sign: no real chili’ maker would use ground meat. Use cubed, small , half inch or so. Your butcher will be happy to grind this style for you. Ground beef is school cafeteria chili!. Masa or a facsimile is essential. Otherwise you end up with chili soup."
2002294030,69173,2018-10-07,5,Great recipe that makes a tender meatball that doesn't fall apart. My dinner guests raved over the flavor and texture. I also made a small batch with 1oz. of dried porcini mushrooms that were also very nice.
2001710139,295178,2018-10-07,0,I had this collection of recipe cards years ago. This one was a favorite. It was a simple week night dinner and very flavorful.
2002293711,205890,2018-10-06,5,"This is very similar to the recipe I learned, in the Fanny Farmer Cookbook, way back in the 1970's! To add a twist I substitute pure Almond Extract instead of Vanilla. Here's the clinching move, flatten out one cookie place a slice of Banana on top, flatten out another cookie, take the second cookie and place on top of the first (with Banana slice) cookie - make sure it covers the Banana slice, then Bake. Stuffed Cookies! Get creative because you know whats Peanut Butter without JAM? :)"
2002293627,16130,2018-10-06,5,Very simple and very delicious a nice healthy dessert. I cut the sugar to 1 cup in both the pudding and meringue. Perfect!
2002293812,79595,2018-10-06,5,Delicious! Will definitely be making again.
2002293812,39331,2018-10-06,1,We thought this was very bland
2002293703,352798,2018-10-06,5,"This is the best bread! I love the hard, domed crust. It's easy and great with soup."
2002293580,15062,2018-10-06,5,"My mom also crumbled bacon into the lettuce. She heated the bacon grease. Added a little flour to it and stirred until it browned. She then added the vinegar, sugar and water. This made a thicker sauce on the lettuce"
2002293252,41330,2018-10-06,5,"Fantastic..and guess what,I substituted boneless pork chops for the chicken last week..again Fantastic!"
2001512802,408065,2018-10-06,3,I live at 8500 feet and it takes longer than 20 minutes for a good hard boiled egg here. I would love to see a chart that shows how much to increase the time for every 1000 feet of elevation above sea level.
2002151614,300338,2018-10-06,5,I love this recipe!! Turned out amazing!! I'm definitely going to make it again.
2002293124,278278,2018-10-06,3,They definitely need more liquid so I just kept adding soy milk till I got my desired consistency.
2002218101,535673,2018-10-06,5,"Unfortunately, i wasn't able to find cojita cheese so I used feta instead, but it was still amazing. There were no leftovers..."
2000498330,134051,2018-10-06,4,An easy breakfast cake that was just slightly on the dry side. Didn't keep us from eating it. Think it could use a little oil in the batter. The topping is awesome.
2002144249,12058,2018-10-06,0,good stuff to make &quot;Michaledas&quot; (add beer).
2001962574,73166,2018-10-06,5,"It is the best I've ever tasted, but my tastes and others often disagree. It may not be for you but I make it very often"
2002293504,226245,2018-10-06,5,hii plz send recipe for pinapple preserve
2002293650,112889,2018-10-06,5,"Worked like a charm, PERFECT! Cooked and served in the shells with some extra OLD BAY on the side. My best ever!"
2002058273,38298,2018-10-06,5,"AHMAZING! What a hit! Will definitely make this again and again. Read all the tweaks and suggestions of Past reviews, lots of creative Liberties can be taken with this exceptional recipe. It was easy and delicious, exactly as promised. I used twice as much kale and all organic ingredients for a healthy and hearty autumn treat!"
2002293677,62254,2018-10-06,5,"Fantastic! I signed up just so I can leave a review this with such a delicious, moist, just amazing recipe. And I am not a baker!! I substitute brown sugar for white, and added some of the other suggested editions of half a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. It was delicious!! They needed the full 25mins. And we're obsessed. I must be turning into a Baker because I already had all these ingredients at home, who knew."
2001498538,344164,2018-10-06,5,"This all began with a friend telling me about a recipe to make French onion soup in the oven. This turned out superb. I substituted Pernod for the dry Sherry. I did do several more rotations of water and removing carmelization from pan bottom. This soups flavor, amazing. I made it a day early, I know it will only get better. Delighted to have found this recipe."
2002293601,322348,2018-10-06,0,"This is not sourdough bread. This is commercial yeast bread. I tire of people posting &quot;sourdough&quot; bread recipes, that contain commercial yeast - including King Arthur Flour. Please stop."
2000292208,227219,2018-10-06,5,This is great mostly because it doesn’t have any nasty Vermont syrup in it
2002293210,79506,2018-10-06,0,"I noticed a few people asking why their gelatin started clumping up, or there were tiny balls of gelatin in the cream, this happens because a). the gelatin wasn’t dissolved correctly, I find using gelatin sheets much easier for this application, I’m a professional baker, in this industry the sheets are the only way to go. Unfortunately not everyone can find them at the grocery store, you can get them online at Amazon.. Good Luck to all, btw this recipe is my fail safe, been using it for years."
486725,298965,2018-10-06,5,"This was a really good quick weeknight meal. Reminiscent of Manhattan clam chowder, which we love. I added a little squeeze of lemon over it at the table. This recipe would work well with spaghetti I am sure too."

2002293748,60350,2018-10-06,5,"I liked the creaminess of it. I Followed it exactly, but didn't have cheddar cheese on hand. I used Mexican four cheese blend and threw a bit of garlic salt into it."
2002293362,9054,2018-10-06,4,"They tasted great, but fell apart like crazy in the frying pan. They weren't pretty like the picture..."
2002201259,133448,2018-10-06,1,"I love ramen, especially Top Ramen with home made stock (less salt). I did the recipe with great anticipation, because what's not better with cheese? I found this recipe with american cheese to be absolutely disgusting and threw it out. But it was worth a try. Maybe with better quality cheese..."
2002293562,80621,2018-10-06,5,"A friend gifted me with several butternut squash, something I had never cooked with.. This recipe turned out perfectly!"
1378490,31167,2018-10-06,4,"We liked this recipe a lot! I found it this morning and made it, so can't vouch for the overnight portion, but same day it's delicious. Per other review recommendations, I used two extra apples, cut back a bit of the sugar from the apple mixture and put it instead in the egg mixture. I didn't have my 13x9 baking dish so I had to use a smaller one, and probably could have gotten away with less egg/milk mixture because of it, next time I'll make that tweak if I don't have the larger dish. I still wouldn't cut down any of the other components though. I also diced the apples into small cubes instead of thin slices and just cooked on the stove for an extra couple of minutes and would definitely do that again next time. I used a large non-stick pizza pan to flip this out. I put it over the baking dish, making sure it covered entirely, grabbed both the baking dish and pan together (after separating bread from edges of baking dish) and flipped it over in one quick motion, worked perfectly. Thanks for a great breakfast recipe!"
2002293566,204986,2018-10-06,0,Delicious
2002104182,339905,2018-10-06,5,I add an egg and decrease the oil/butter and it's perfect. Thank you!
2002293749,176207,2018-10-06,5,This is the most requested cake I have ever made. Even carrot cake haters loved this one.
2002293018,439891,2018-10-06,5,"Great and easy recipe,, came out perfectly!! Took little longer to cook ,,Very tasty and true to the headline it’s actually a soft and fluffy chocolate cake ?????? Love it!!"
2002293145,117531,2018-10-06,5,"Made these twice now &amp; they've turned out perfectly each time, and everyone loves them. I did make one small change with the spices, I used pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon with 1/4tsp of ground ginger. Will be making them again for sure."
2002293520,347632,2018-10-06,5,Used as starter and added Turkey Meatballs and sauteed green peppers to onion mixture....Yum! Great recipe!
2001785915,110683,2018-10-06,5,Came out great. Poured into our Oster waffle maker and cooked for 11 minutes. Golden crisp delicious waffles!
2000870573,36984,2018-10-06,5,"I doubled the recipe to make it last over the weekend.......my tweaks are minimal but as follows: browned the flour before anything else; added salt, pepper, thyme and parsley to browned flour then added meat to coat (I cut up a chuck roast I had on hand); browned my meat very well in a skillet then transferred the meat to my broth with veggies (new and red potatoes, green beans, corn and carrots); then I cooked the onions and celery til tender in my skillet and added remaining flour to make a roux......mixed together 3cups water and a packet of Au Jus Gravy and added to roux stirring til smooth and quickly added to broth/veggie mix.....topped everything off with chili powder to taste.....absolutely positively delish!!! is what my hubby said:)"
226863,536729,2018-10-06,4,"Colors are great in this salad. For those that love salt, this is a perfect salad. I love all the ingredients, and it is a beautiful salad. But it was just too salty for me. I normally do not salt watermelon so maybe that was it. This was a fun experiment, and now I have some lovely watermelon to enjoy during these 90 + days we seem to be having in October! Made for your win in Football Tag. Thanks for sharing!"
2002281598,520826,2018-10-06,0,"Instead of vegetable or coconut oil, use sesame seed oil. Anything you add this into instantly gets that &quot;Chinese food&quot; taste. Just 1 -2 teaspoons is enough to flavor a whole dish."
2002155064,90502,2018-10-06,4,"This bread was a hot mess to make bit tasted delicious! I added 2 tsp of vanilla extract. The dough was wayyy too wet. I had to add much more than 2 tsp of flour to make up for the 2 tsp of liquid (vanilla). I pretty much had to &quot;babysit&quot; the dough adding flour and scraping the sides until it held together in a smooth ball. It was still pretty sticky when I removed the paddle before the &quot;bake&quot; cycle. Then the top broke/cracked but never got crisp. Tasted amazing, though!"
2002293133,213499,2018-10-06,4,"Too chunky, had to smooth it out. The coment about not liking Chinese restaurant duck sauce should be taken with a grain of salt. This only applies to the pre-packaged stuff. If you ask for their homemade sauce many chinese restaurants will provide it for a dollar or two extra in little container. I will not frequent any chinese restaurant that only supplies packaged condiments."
2002293624,359799,2018-10-06,4,"The substance was indeed too thick, but after adding milk and a little bit of water it turned out really great."
2002292913,181330,2018-10-06,5,Very easy to make and so delicious! I'm not sure I will have any left to freeze.
2002049053,109070,2018-10-06,5,They were delightful
2002293081,365298,2018-10-06,0,"I first tried this (as Flammkuchen) in Basel in Switzerland. I have made it several times using this recipe with great success. The crust was perfectly crisp. Last month, I tried it again (as Tarte Flamb&eacute;e) in Alsace in France. Outstanding. I will be making it again very soon!"
2000498330,133466,2018-10-06,5,"Chicken and rice is a mainstay at my house. This is a very good comfort food casserole that is both creamy and crunchy. An enjoyable meal; leftovers reheat well. I cooked it same day as I assembled it, but nice to have the instructions for OAMC."
2002293587,2886,2018-10-06,0,"This really is the best banana recipe I have ever had--well, with just a few changes: I didn’t use as much sugar-I only used 5/8 cup sugar, and it was plenty sweet-I generally find most sweet items in the US to be too sweet. I replaced the sugar with 3/8 cup cashew milk because sugar is a liquid in baking. I also added about 2/3 cup chopped hazel nuts, 1/3 cup ground hazel nuts and &frac12; cup toasted dried coconut (small grate). I changed out the soda for baking powder because I thought it would rise better. I made 6 large MUFFINS instead of a loaf, and I think they were the best banana muffins I have ever had. Let cool a full 5 minutes before taking out of the muffin pan and they are beautiful!"

2002292090,327682,2018-10-05,5,"It tastes really good, but my yield was not 6 half pints. I only got 3 and didn't cook it as long. Maybe it was the type of apples I used? I used Rome apples."
2001669916,482219,2018-10-05,4,"This was a great recipe, just a bit sweeter than I’d prefer. Also, molasses is an ingredient in BBQ sauce so didn’t know if that could have been added. Thank you for a lovely recipe not using ketchup!"
2002292632,174189,2018-10-05,4,Delicious!
2002292510,22782,2018-10-05,0,"Our favorite sauce! I make this frequently, and get a spaghetti dinner and lasagna from it. I only have one stockpot, so I get it started, then put it in the slow cooker. I cut back on the water, and add another dash of wine just before serving."
2001639661,362231,2018-10-05,5,I love this cake. I used to make it a lot but haven't been able to find my recipe. I didnt use the topping. I just used the Duncan Hines Lemon Frosting and melted it as wanted for a warm glaze.
2002292423,274177,2018-10-05,5,"Made this after an associate from Sudan told me about the dish. Not difficult to make at all, although I would suggest 2 people to make the Msemmen. Brought it into work and it was an absolute hit. My associate from Sudan was completely surprised. I've been asked to make it several times since. Also, I've made the sauce a couple times as a standalone dish and served it with msemmen. I've done it with chicken stock and vegetable stock (for the vegans in my group) instead of water. Also very delicious. Thank you for sharing this great recipe."

2002270564,22782,2018-10-05,5,Hands down the best spaghetti sauce I've ever had. And I've had lots of spaghetti sauces! It was so good that I had some for lunch the next day. Thank you Sharlene and Genius Kitchen!
1388322,520488,2018-10-05,5,"I made this soup on the cook-top. It is delicious! The Italian sausage gives it a unique flavor; 1/2 pound is plenty. For the salsa, I used the 12 oz jar of Salsa Autentica from Trader Joe's. Trader Joe's also has cans of organic garbanzo beans. I did add 2 stalks of celery when I added the parsley. Also, instead of just spinach, I used a mixture of spinach, kale, and swiss chard (the organic power greens from Costco). I recommend using a pound of greens. I will add this soup to my permanent repertoire of soups. Thanks Charlyn W."

2002292754,162864,2018-10-05,5,This soup is amazing. My children even liked it. I did put in 12 more ounces of diced tomatoes. I added two cups of water. I also simmered it for an extra hour. It was so good. Thanks

1803169145,3579,2018-10-05,3,This is like the one my Mother and Grandmother made but they would of put cinnamon or a blend of apple pie spices. Now you can you can by a an apple spice blend in a jar.Should try it sometime. The best way to eat is warm out of the oven with good vanilla ice cream. yum.

2002292109,20356,2018-10-05,5,"My husband worked in a kitchen with a Cordon Bleu Chef, years ago. He wrote down the ingredients for several salad dressings, Roquefort being the most popular by far. The problem, he neglected to include the proportions. Over the years I whipped up fairly reasonable facsimiles, but they always seemed a little off. Finally, here is exactly what I needed to make it perfect! Only 1 slight difference, Hubs recipe called for A1 sauce, and Worcestershire Sauce. Not sure why both, they always seemed much the same to me. But French Chef's rely on subtle differences."
526411,513343,2018-10-05,5,This is great! I've made it several times but lost the recipe. I do remember that the original recipe called for blueberry topping instead of pie filling. The pie filling works much better. I came here in search of this recipe.
2002292730,360032,2018-10-05,5,These were delicious! I needed an eggless recipe as I’d run out of eggs! They turned out chewey crispy! I’ll be baking another batch today!
2002292140,449452,2018-10-05,5,"Delicious, tastes like rotisserie chicken from the store. The only thing I changed was using creole seasoning instead of season all. Next time I'd like to add a little sesame oil to the soy sauce and see how that turns out."

2002292527,199367,2018-10-05,5,"This was so easy and fast and tasted really good. I made this because I ran out of the store bought dipping &quot;almond bark&quot; stuff and need more immediately. This worked great, and we had leftover. So I reheated it (after stored in refrigerator overnight) and drizzled it over ice cream the next day. It was like homemade magic shell - the kids LOVED it. Since then, I make it just for that purpose! I might try coconut oil in the future since other comments had success with that."

I feel 1 1/2 bars would be plenty (when doubling the recipe). Per request from my kids, this will be made again!"

2002292464,493141,2018-10-05,5,"So I made this last night and it was really tasty. I did take salt and pepper my chicken directly (and I used salt free seasoning from the dollar tree), I also used regular paprika and I only had limes ?? so that's what I used... I'm lazy so I left the bones in and put the olive mixture under the skin. Served it with sweet potatoes and sauteed kale."

2002291849,289825,2018-10-04,5,"I've made this several times over the past couple of years, and it's always a big hit!! I haven't had to tweak it at all, don't even need to precook the chicken. Just make sure to oil the sides or stir frequently as it can stick to the sides if you leave it in the cooker for a while."
2002291567,43014,2018-10-04,5,"It was outstanding! I really browned the pork chops first and seasoned well and then I cubed them up. I also added carrots, celery, new potatoes and zucchini because i was out of spinach. So tasty! Easy-breezy and I highly recommend!"
2002291352,92094,2018-10-04,5,"The sauce is good, but would have been too hot for my wife. I ended up adding an 8th cup of sugar and about half a cup of heavy cream...it turned out way better than expected. Super unhealthy with all that cream on top of butter, but really good."

I will definitely make this again!!"
198154,117222,2018-10-04,4,"I used extra minced garlic and whole grain garlic mustard because that's what we had on hand and we love our garlic. While we enjoyed the flavor, we all felt it was extremely mild. Next time I will let it marinade longer before putting it on the grill."
2002291277,153542,2018-10-04,5,"Great low carb soup! Next time I make it I won’t put quite as much sour cream in, it almost overpowered the rest of the flavors."
2002291682,145312,2018-10-04,0,Is this recipe for mini muffins or full size muffins? Would it be 1.5 WW points plus for a mini and 3 for a full size?
2851533,279060,2018-10-04,5,turned out perfect !!! An excellent alternative to tomato based sauce. Made this twice and my wife and I absolutely love this.
2002291501,42780,2018-10-04,0,This didn't taste anything like Long John Silvers batter. It was bland bland bland. Ug. Wasted my chicken.
2002291249,107356,2018-10-04,5,This is an amazing recipe. I followed to a tee other than using toasted sesame oil instead. My new favorite for pork loin. Excellence. Caprese salad and fresh Brussels sprouts go well with the sweetness.
2000498330,2537,2018-10-04,5,"My first try at making apple pie. Glad I chose this recipe. For my taste, it was perfection. I used Granny Smith apples and the filling was not syrupy sweet, but just right. And the lemon really adds that something special to the flavor. Nailed it. I used premade pie dough and it worked out fine. So happy."
2683183,283100,2018-10-04,5,"Delicious! I used a red pepper rather than a green one, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The filling was delicious, but I would like to have it a little more juicy. Not sure how I will accomplish this. The dough is excellent. I will make it again."
2002133067,83993,2018-10-04,5,"Delicious! I had larger potatoes, so I cut them up into 2 inch chunks. I will definitely be making this often through the fall season."
305531,536734,2018-10-04,4,These beans were simple and good. It was pouring rain........so I baked the packet in the oven which worked great. Thanks for sharing.
2002279220,231701,2018-10-04,5,"Soooo good and so easy, too. made it in 5 minutes, then stuck it in the freezer and it set in about 25 minutes. Over all, it was super easy to put together, and delicious. I will be making this again."
2002291687,78123,2018-10-04,0,"I'm going to try this Saturday for a chili cook off at a baby shower. I was looking for sweet and spicy :) Anyway, I'm going to use less honey (seems a bit too sweet for me) and add a little red pepper to mine. I'll let you know how it goes!"
2002190476,493413,2018-10-04,0,I agree with Mrs. Brenda. The directions are very confusing. The chicken part doesn't make sense
2002291618,445224,2018-10-04,5,I made these but omitted the salt due to being on a strict low sodium diet. They were so good! I am going to make another batch and try using honey instead of white processed sugar!
2002291414,258765,2018-10-04,4,Lemon was a bit strong and consistency was not as creamy as I'd like. I added a smidge more mayo. Hoping a night in the fridge will mellow it out. Great color.
2002291637,377759,2018-10-04,5,"Loved this, much better than the last recipe I tried! The baking powder gives them a little lift which is nice. I made these in a deep hot iron skillet."
2002042054,81853,2018-10-04,0,I have not tried this yet. I am wondering why you need flour and onions in Mac and cheese.
2002269612,60824,2018-10-04,4,Not bad. Added about 1/8 C more flour and a teaspoon of vanilla.
2002291411,166309,2018-10-04,4,"Great basic, tasty recipe. Old school, classic. However, didn’t specify what type of relish. I used dill. Yum!"
2002250916,163705,2018-10-04,5,So delicious. Will definitely make this again.
2002291563,193445,2018-10-04,0,"awesome recipe Many years I have hosted a GINGERBREAD HOUSE party for my daughter and 5 friends. Began hosting when daughter was just 10 yrs ..Now that she is a grown woman of 20 she and her friends still enjoy this time together. SO EASY. I start putting the houses together in October, they decorate Thanksgiving weekend .. MY OPINION NOTHING NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED. Just add that the pieces/house stores very well in cool dry place ( hall closet). ready for decorating . So much fun to see the different decorating ideas , creativity of each young woman."
2002291373,94198,2018-10-04,5,"I want get rid of leftover ground beef from other receipt. I made a mistake, I had a 4 lbs of ground beef, added 8 tsp. Garlic salt and onion powder ?? I ran in to the grocery store get more ground beef. Ended I made 36 patties. Cooked one pattie Very delicious better than MC... Finally I enjoyed beef pattie ^.* I also added diced onion my taste. Thanks!"
1012877,145719,2018-10-04,5,"My dad loved the pecan cream pie at the Dutch Mill. He asked the server how to make it, and it has to be the easiest pie ever to make! I’ll post it for you under Dutch Mill Pecan Cream Pie."
2002291457,383868,2018-10-04,5,"These are great! Added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the dough. The flavor is really good, they puffed up nicely."
2002291904,114392,2018-10-04,5,"There is a place in Sioux City, IA that has the best pizza sauce on their pizzas I've ever tasted. This recipe is really close to it. I added about two-three Tablespoons of honey and some cyan pepper. Love it!!"
2002291211,75659,2018-10-03,4,"I did not have apple juice available, so I used water with a tablespoon of vanilla. When the apple pie mix was done cooking and thickening, I added three tablespoons of butter. The result was a very rich creamy pie filling. I ultimately used in Apple coffee cake recipe from Betty Crocker bread machine cookbook."
2001909080,227127,2018-10-03,5,Good recipe ! Thank you.
400708,451331,2018-10-03,4,"So simple and warming, easy to make and fit the bill for a clear soup that I was looking for. I didn't use the spaghetti, as I wanted to try something new to me Eierstich (a german egg custard garnish) and this was perfect for that. We so enjoyed this for a light supper with crusty french bread on the side"
211009,328537,2018-10-03,5,"I'm in awe. My kids were all over this recipe. I thought I'd have extra for lunch tomorrow, but they licked the pot clean. It's a winner!"
2001346577,301754,2018-10-03,5,"Loved this soup! Very flavorful and wonderful texture. I especially love that it can be made without a roux as I'm not very adept at that. Hubby loved it, too. I made it in my Instant Pot using the slow cooker feature."
2002290607,336374,2018-10-03,5,I made this cake today and the aroma is amazing. I made a few changes by using 2/4 c cocoa and 1/4 c dark cocoa by Hersey’s. I also added one tsp of pure almond extract. I am going to frost it with a white chocolate glaze...mmmmmm!!
2002291075,83609,2018-10-03,0,This is the second time I have make this dish and it is so good my husband said its the best
93446,479879,2018-10-03,5,This was really good and reminded me of a recipe that my mom used to make sometimes. I didn't know what kind of pork seasoning you used so I made it with Penzey's Bavarian Seasoning. It came out so tasty and my husband just loved it. I will definitely make this again.
2002291027,2886,2018-10-03,5,I added 1 tsp of cinnamon. Best banana bread ever!
2002291028,81259,2018-10-03,5,These turned out beautifully... soft and peanut-buttery! Will keep as my go-to peanut butter cookie recipe!
2002290964,104215,2018-10-03,5,Super easy and delicious! I've been making a similar version of this for years.
2002290685,525922,2018-10-03,5,Saw these tarts being made on The Great British Bake Off and found this easy to make recipe online. They were OUTSTANDING!!! Make sure you follow all the steps (especially when you take the pastry out of the oven the first time) and you will have a true crowd-pleaser!!
1633565,535321,2018-10-03,5,"LOVE this recipe! The only changes I made was to lightly salt the chicken before dredging in flour, using dill instead of bread and butter pickles, and adding a little mayo to the buns when assembling. Makes a lot of slaw so I repurposed it by adding a little lime juice, cilantro and garlic salt and added it to a cilantro lime chicken salad that I made. It was delicious!"
2002202055,240022,2018-10-03,5,This is third time posting and made this dish for first. AWESOME time infinity
2002222573,156657,2018-10-03,5,"I really was surprised when it said that you have to microwave it first, but sure enough it worked like a charm. It made little hiss and bubble noises in the microwave, which I was scared of at first. I though I was cooking a wasp behind the oven! Any way, it really turned out great. I added a little bit of olive oil to the potatoes before I baked them and it made them a little bit crispier. I really enjoyed it! Thank you!"
2002284144,286290,2018-10-03,4,Really good..even better the next time..I added fresh basil and cilantro. Used corn and black beans as per my son's request. Its gonna be a regular dish for us.
2002290661,35889,2018-10-03,0,"Sabeen U to clarify...you need a total of 5C. First you use 2C which you add to the yeast, then mix with the wet ingredients. Then you add the other 2-3C to this batter to make the dough. It's in two separate stages. Hope this helps."
2002290821,320787,2018-10-03,0,improvise to taste ….I never completely follow recipes myself......
2002290606,122046,2018-10-03,5,So I made this recipe during our kitchen renovation...meaning I did it in my backyard on a couple of hot plates that thankfully work really well. Was it easy doing it this way? No but the end result was so worth it... and once again we didn't have to eat out which is my main goal during our renovation. Tweaks: 1 stick of butter for the sauce. I used fresh squeezed lemon (3) and probably doubled the white wine for the reduction sauce. Added fresh chopped garlic to saute with pancetta and thinly sliced red onion (that's all I had) for the veg saute. I have to say this was so scrumptious!
2002291149,33269,2018-10-03,5,As a Dutchman I love &quot;boerenkool met worst&quot;. As an addition I always add bacon/pancetta or prosciutto which I bake out until it's crispy. When I visit the Netherlands I always take some &quot;Rookworst&quot; with me :-)
2002057291,249030,2018-10-03,5,"Definitely 5 star rating! I would add chopped zucchini and chopped spinach, escarole or collared greens for more veggies and a more colorful minestrone. Yum!"
1803438568,169019,2018-10-03,0,"I hit the water-meat mixture with a stick blender after adding the onions but before adding the remaining ingredients. Gave the perfect texture. After reviewing these comments I'll leave the onions out next time - after spending most of my adult life after college in Cincinnati, I'm a purist!"
2001936857,108364,2018-10-03,5,"I've tried many fried chicken recipes and this is the best so far. Followed the recipe as written. The baking powder does wonders for the coating. I keep the cooked chicken warm in a 275&deg; oven on a rack while finishing frying rest (2 batches). When done, poured off the fat and used the dark brown flour bits to make a gravy. Just added a bit more flour, pepper and chicken boulion. .. cooked a bit more then added whole milk. Yummy. Thanks for posting. I know I will be using this recipe again!"
2002290674,256722,2018-10-03,2,"This recipe did not turn out to be a french baguette dough. The dough was dry--baguette dough should be wetter than your average dough. I've seen other recipes that don't require kneading. Instead, the wet dough should have multiple resting periods of about 45 min each, folding the dough a few times in between the resting times. That is what gives the baguette its good flavor. This recipe turned out more like a common white bread loaf that has a very close texture and bland flavor. I baked it at 400 F for 20 minutes with steam added to try to get a nice crust. Since it was so dense and dry, there wasn't much of a crust. The result was just a plain, dense, chewy mess. Also, sesame seeds don't go on french baguettes. Refer to this website for basic baguette info: https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-buy-bread-french-way"
128473,379516,2018-10-03,5,"Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe Lori. It's awesome; quick, easy, light and satisfying. I used 2 mini tortillas (all I had) they worked great in this dish. I ended up with 6 tasty pieces. It was a lovely lunch, full of textures and flavor. Made as written, for Think Pink 2018."
2002291139,334483,2018-10-03,5,"Made this recently for a work event... and got tons of compliments! Chose it because it works well for vegetarian and vegan colleagues. I roasted the sweet potatoes, red potatoes and carrots separate from other 'softer' veggies so I could cook them longer; also left out mushrooms - wasn't sure who liked them. Used whole carrots, chopped. Wonderful flavors and colors, easy to adapt based on what you have on hand, what's in season, on sale, etc. Definitely line pan; I used parchment. Will make again - SOON! I just discovered your site and love it!"
2002278011,213403,2018-10-03,5,"This. Was. Amazing! My aunt makes mayo topped tilapia all the time and I wanted to replicate it. I even got my sisters 7yo daughter to try it (she hates onions)and she loved it (until I told her it had onions of course)! Being from Maryland, I had to add extra Old Bay; never going back to plain mayo!"
2002291214,227817,2018-10-03,5,"Loved your recipe! Although I added some extras, the base of this is so amazing. I added 1 lb of sweet Italian sausage, an additional pound of lean ground beef, 2 carrots sliced thin, 1 small can sliced black olives-drained the juice, and 1/2 cup of golden raisins. You’re probably thinking, raisins in chili is weird” but my Hispanic grandmother used raisins in her tamale meat mixture. My dad started to put raisins in his chili and it’s incredible so I copied them. I emplor you to just give it a try. Sooo good!"
198154,162006,2018-10-03,4,DH said this had great flavor. The steaks weren't very think so I only let them marinade 24hrs.
2002189122,26846,2018-10-03,5,"It was really good. I marinated the chicken in salt and pepper about an hour before cooking it. Also, I used frozen Pillsbury biscuits instead for the crust. I thawed them and cut them in quarters. Placed on top and cooked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees."
128473,536070,2018-10-03,5,"Delicious scones Bonnie, absolutely delicious. Quick and easy to make also. Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe that I will enjoy often. The glaze is the perfect topping for this wonderful treat. Made FYC tag game."
2002290576,229958,2018-10-03,0,Slower Lower uses a slippery dumpling similar to a noodle. Annes dumplings are prefered. Above the canal a biscuit dumpling is most common as described in this recipe.
1803291363,117806,2018-10-03,0,"Recipe sounds great - I'd like to try it, but want to bake the meatballs? Anyone have suggestions for oven temp &amp; timing?"
198154,460857,2018-10-03,4,We had some baby red potatoes and garlic chives in our basket of goodies from the farmers market. A great way to use both. We love garlic so we used the garlic salt and pepper grinder instead of plain table salt. Served as a side to grilled chicken and Italian green beans.
2002290908,17582,2018-10-03,0,how many calories does it have.
2001521034,532078,2018-10-03,4,"I didn't do the potatoes as per the recipe because smashed potatoes was less effort, but the chicken and sprouts I did do (almost) according to the (admittedly dubious) instructions. This was surprisingly good for so little effort! Usually I take HOURS to make anything that's not just eggs or a sandwich, so the fact that this came together in under an hour was awesome. I subbed red wine vinegar for the balsamic because that's all I had, and used a sprig (maybe a tbsp?) of fresh rosemary as the recipe didn't say how much. I also ignored the extra tbsp olive oil for sauteing the veggies, because the oil and fat from searing the chicken was already plenty - I ended up having to drain a lot of it in order to get a fond for deglazing. Because I did smashed potatoes, I took the leftover liquids after roasting it all and reduced it with butter to make a nice gravy, which was obviously quite delicious."
2002290661,46072,2018-10-03,5,Absolutely delicious! I didn't have any raisins so used mixed dried fruit; hubby thought that rush of dried citrus a bit much hahaha. So raisins/sultanas on the shopping list. Also didn't need to initially boil rice for 20-mins. Absorption method kicked in after only 10 or so. Used medium-grain.
2001691387,299148,2018-10-03,5,"Used skirt steak and grilled it, and all was delish! Could use sauce as a dip as well -- was so yummy (added lots more cheese)!"
2002290080,97496,2018-10-02,5,"I’ve made these cookies, but made them different ways. Instead of vanilla, I added lavender extract and zest of one lemon. Instead of cinnamon and sugar I used, sugar in the raw and finely chopped lavender flowers (dried). These are fabulous I’ve had a lot of compliments doing this with the cookies! I’m going to do a brown butter, salted caramel version of this using salted caramel crown royal instead of vanilla, and adding a caramel center."
2002290281,389287,2018-10-02,5,O love this rezipee
95960,137860,2018-10-02,5,"I cut this recipe in half...it is perfect for the recipes I cook for just the two of us. After saut&eacute;ing the onions and garlic, I deglaze with a touch of red or white wine, add 1/2 Tbs of tomato paste and brown the paste a bit, then proceed with the recipe. Fantastic!"
2002289834,231701,2018-10-02,5,Is better to add in powdered sugar instead if it is grainy
2002290376,108231,2018-10-02,3,Uninteresting
2002289651,265634,2018-10-02,5,Thank you! I'm no cook it turned out good!!
2721690,378924,2018-10-02,5,This marinade is delicious. I usually make a double batch and marinate several meals worth of chops and do some chicken breasts also. I then freeze all but what is to be eaten right away. So easy to pull out of the freezer and let thaw and marinate in the fridge for a couple of days.
2002289985,256210,2018-10-02,5,Made them in a ramakin
242766,511958,2018-10-02,5,"We really enjoyed these easy, delicious cookies. I thought they were yummy, but I knew the real test was to see what my husband thought of them. Oatmeal raisin cookies are his all-time favorite cookie and when he gave them 2-thumbs up, I knew we had a winner. My first pan out of the oven produced cookies that had spread too much and were very thin. I added a little extra flour to the remaining batter and that did the trick. The rest of the cookies turned out perfect. I got about 3 dozen cookies out of the recipe and a very happy husband. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. **Made for 2018 Football Pool**"
2833590,51550,2018-10-02,5,"Although my cornbread came out looking lumpy, it was amazing. The taste was perfect, and I was afraid that adding the little amount of sugar it called for would make it too sweet. It was not sweet at all and had a really great taste. The directions were easy to follow. The next time I make it, I might stir the ingredients a little longer, but it did not change the taste at all."
2001618307,43806,2018-10-02,0,The only thing I would do different is forget the flour and oil and bake the meatballs and sausage in the oven at 400 for about 35 minutes. Give or take depending on the size of your meatballs. It's a bit quicker but everything else is fantastic
2002290373,87420,2018-10-02,5,"The soup is salty so instead of using that, I chopped up fresh onions on the roast, seasoned it, and just used cream of mushroom soup. Yum and not salty."
2001829873,438551,2018-10-02,5,"This was a big hit! Because of my smaller crockpot size, I cut the meat to 1 lb, only 2 potatoes, and 2 cups of chopped carrots, but the rest of the veggies the same. I also used a can of Italian style chopped tomatoes, 3 cups low sodium beef broth, plus 1 soup can broth, an extra half tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon of chopped garlic, and 1 teaspoon Emeril's Essence. Next time I will try adding cabbage or kale."
2002290217,64353,2018-10-02,5,"This is wonderful. THE BEST! A shame the photo is so awful because it is certainly not a good representation of the finished product. My family loves this and says it is the best ever. Do not hesitate to try this recipe. The gravy is rich, I used a cornstarch slurry to thicken it and that is the only change I ever made. Wish I had taken a photo...Next time!"
2002289806,299148,2018-10-02,4,"I made this tonight and it was good, but one thing is not clear to me. Do we actually put cold sauce on hot steak? The directions don't mention warming it but it seems weird to me."
2002290418,500210,2018-10-02,3,"Good but overcooked. I will go about an hour and 3/4 next time. Other than that, all was good."
316834,58516,2018-10-02,0,Wasn't at all impressed with the jelly i made. I thot &quot;how can it possibly have so many great reviews?&quot; Then I decided to double check my recipe and realized I switched the amounts on the sugar and vinegar! LOL! Fortunately I had a great pepper harvest so I will try again.
2002289768,262140,2018-10-02,0,"Can you use cheddar cheese soup, instead of shredded cheese?"
1179225,352501,2018-10-02,5,"This turned out great! I wish I had hotter curry powder so it the dish would have had more of a kick, but it was still really yummy! Topped with more cilantro. I'm looking forward to making it again and adding zucchini or maybe some tofu. Thanks for sharing this simple and delicious recipe."
2000064953,114392,2018-10-02,5,"I've made this twice (doubled the recipe both times) - definitely a keeper and no comparison to store-bought. My only tweaks: I added a half-tablespoon of garlic salt, crushed the fennel seeds (mortar and pestle), and used a hand-blender when it was done to make it smooth. The leftovers keep really well in the freezer."
2002290264,142192,2018-10-02,5,"I've made this chili several times over the years, after discovering it in 1980! The beauty is that, after dining on a masterful meat-only chili, you can stretch the leftovers (if any) by adding beans and without losing any of the wonderful flavor!"
2002289838,8603,2018-10-02,5,Made these and they were amazing even if I put in 3/4cup of milk oops. Have saved the recipe for future making. Love love love these with ??.
2001986418,302120,2018-10-02,5,"anazing! first time making it.. i used ketchup and did instant mash.. wow! sooo gooooooooooooood, next time I'll add guiness even my 1 year old loved it.."
1852581,210757,2018-10-02,2,"For my taste, this was far too watery to even taste any cheese. I used a full pound of the cheese, added a little miso, and still had to add some corn starch slurry to thicken it (which worked very easily). I also think one of the other folks posting had it on the barrel head - use fresh broccoli; the frozen emits a great deal of water. Will keep the recipe (love the simple ingreds and it's pretty!) but make these adjustments to it. And will remove from my WW recipe file :)"
2001842062,55282,2018-10-02,4,"Great idea and I like all the ingredients but the one thing it's missing is salt. You really do need some for the best flavor, in my opinion."
2002290188,254593,2018-10-02,0,I'm a little confused. Is this just a method for getting chicken from frozen to un-frozen? (beginner). Susan
2002290154,14684,2018-10-02,0,"Try roasting your veggies first (zucchini, mushrooms and if using, add bell peppers) for 1/2 hour before putting them in the lasagna pan to give it a fuller flavour and to dry out the veggies a bit. Zucchini, mushrooms and bell peppers have a lot of moisture and that's probably where your soupy consistency is coming from. This also cuts down on baking time. Keep tweaking the recipe, it will be great."
2002290176,266675,2018-10-02,0,Please don’t put a cold baking stone into a pre-heated 400 degree oven. Your baking stone will suffer thermal shock and likely crack. Put the stone in a cold oven and pre-heat both at the same time.
2002290282,430071,2018-10-02,5,I tried your recipe and it came out perfect. Loooove it!!!!!
2002289940,175322,2018-10-02,0,I'm making this right now for a neighborhood pot luck happening in 8 hours. I love that it's really from scratch and since my oven decided to go on the fritz after already soaking the beans overnight this stove top method is a life saver.
2002289787,369853,2018-10-02,5,They are beautiful!!!
226863,175807,2018-10-02,5,Delicious! Tastes like a Pecan pe with less work! This is a definite repeat recipe. Made for your win in Football Tag game 2018. Thanks for sharing!
531256,165363,2018-10-02,5,"I made this tonight and it is really amazing! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand or what I could find. I didn't use Lily buds, or wood ear mushrooms since I couldn't find them, but I substituted dried oyster mushrooms. I also didn't pay attention and added the scallions to the pan when I added the cabbage. The last thing I did differently is instead of the sherry I used a few spoonfuls of the liquid from the dried mushrooms. I did make the pancakes and it was much easier than I thought it would be. I ate this with my almost 16 year old nephew and we almost ate it all! Thanks for posting!"

2247485,198710,2018-10-02,1,Yuck. This was nothing like ohana. Threw it away immediately.
2002289652,432854,2018-10-01,5,Amazing recipe! I recommend using “robust” olive oil for a floral component and consider extra red pepper if you like a little bite. This rub adds plenty of flavor and the lemon juice puts this recipe over the top. I’ve made ribs for 25+ years and this is my new favorite recipe! I’ll be making this again this weekend for friends!
2002289067,387472,2018-10-01,0,"It came out well, had a little bit of turmeric powder nd the taste was wow! Thanks so much..."
2001415877,80156,2018-10-01,5,"This recipe is awesome! If you find you followed the recipe exactly and the dough seems a bit dry, your egg may not have been big enough. Crack another egg in a separate bowl, beat it a little so it’s easy to spoon a tbsp at a time into your dough as the mixer mixes it on low. speed. You’ve added enough when your dough comes together and is a bit more moist. ;)"
2001847749,177967,2018-10-01,4,"This was very good and sweet like cake but I couldn't really taste the peanut butter except as an aftertaste - I think the choc chips overpowered that flavor. The crumb topping looks nice, but next time I would just mix in the sugar and some softened butter into the batter and cut the choc chips to 1/2 cup. You can't taste the cocoa powder - I think it's just for the marbleizing effect (and I'm not fond of peanuts so I'd leave those out)."
2000902007,146414,2018-10-01,5,I want to make these for a bridal shower coming up. But I need to make shapes out of the dough. Will this dough be ok if I roll it out and cut shapes out with a cookie cutter? Will they spread in the oven? Thanks!
2002288904,35771,2018-10-01,0,I have not tried this but I am Basque and all my family are in Hondarribia and my Aunt makes us this dish. I have never ever seen it with Shrimp so that part is incorrect. I dont recall if they put peppers in it but I dont recall that either. I asked her for the recipe so I can follow up.
2002289599,74010,2018-10-01,5,Great! Half it. Makes plenty and I also melted the butter. Takes like Texas chocolate sheet cake
2002260120,196095,2018-10-01,0,never leave salt out...brings out the flavors of everything else! Get a beef broth that is low or no sodium...that's why it's so salty.
2001993143,33671,2018-10-01,0,"Never rely on a pop-up timer! They can be both inaccurate and are generally programmed for an ultra conservative temperature instead of the ideal 160 degrees that chef's use (and you should be using, too, if you want tender, juicy chicken). Those timers are most likely to give you over cooked chicken."
2002277099,536305,2018-10-01,0,"My question is the same as Christine G. If you're using only 1/2 of the blueberry sauce in the recipe, and putting whole blueberries on top, what do you do with the other half of the sauce?"
2002289564,329047,2018-10-01,5,I love garlic pork.
1049399,536501,2018-10-01,0,"Being Kentucky born and bred, I have never heard of Ky Chili. However, the recipe looks fascinating. However, where does one find bourbon smoked salt, pepper, chili powder and worchestershire sauce?"
2002289556,254206,2018-10-01,0,"Red Food Coloring: There are not any scientific studies that show food coloring hurts humming birds, it is a myth."
2001276677,303245,2018-10-01,5,The recipe worked very well and the ribs came out perfectly.. Instead of putting on the barbecue sauce and returning to the oven I finished it on my gas grill to get some crisp. I have baked the ribs like this many times but I wrapped two ribs separately in aluminum foil for the whole rack. This way was much easier.
2002288831,5170,2018-10-01,5,"Added 2 tbs of brown sugar, 2 tablespoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of nutmeg. Out of this world ! Sweet enough they don't need syrup. Very fluffy. I have also made them before plain, with milk chocolate chips, white chocolate chips and caramel chips. Delicious and perfect every time."
2002288914,50979,2018-10-01,5,"Turned out perfect. I did add oregano, salt and pepper to the flour. It was very easy to make. Will be a repeat. And I agree with another review, the lemon juice is critical."
2001119161,58887,2018-10-01,1,"I followed the recipe exactly and baked 10 minutes. The cookies did not spread out like your picture and they were super dry and hard. 2 thumbs down, waste of ingredients!"
2000196488,47241,2018-10-01,5,"I used Cheetaah's tweaks with the OSF recipe from the placemats. Here are a few tweaks I made: Sauteed the veggies until they were soft with the butter. I then out it in the blender to make it all smooth, put it back on the stove and added the flour to make the roux. I used heavy whipping cream and whole milk (about half and half). Didn't have any ground thyme so I used fresh thyme and let it steep in the mixture of clam juice, whipping cream, salt, white pepper and milk. Let it steep to enhance the flavor of the thyme leaves. Strained out the thyme leaves and added to the roux mixture. Let it thicken by heating slowly to not burn the milk/cream mixture. I did add a little Franck's hot sauce to add a little kick to it, but not too much. I did the browned butter and mizithra broccoli as well to accompany on the side! It was as good if not better than OSF!! Thanks Cheetaah for the additional tweaks...it truly is as good as the original! Keys are to blend the onion, celery and garlic mixture to make a smooth paste. That way there are no chunks!"
2002289558,431399,2018-10-01,0,"Good recipe, I added chai tea to the mix before flour to add a bit of festive flair"
2002289228,183081,2018-10-01,5,Tried this recipe and loved it! Did as others suggested and cut the sugar in half. Also added an egg wash and sesame seed. Will definitely use it again and try it with full sugar. It's a keeper!
2002288861,428671,2018-10-01,5,"Very sweet cake. I baked it in a bundt pan and it turned out pretty well. I thought the syrup would be too watery, but the cake soaked up every last drop. It may be too sweet for me, but I know my coworkers will like it. I also forgot the walnuts, but it still turned out all right."
2417893,482000,2018-10-01,5,Found this recipe on another site and was thrilled to find it in GK after deleting my bookmark to the other. This one is very similar if not the same and we found it absolutely delicious. I'm always looking for recipes I can modify to vegetarian for my daughter and this one will be perfect with the vegie chicken. Looking forward to trying it out on her next time she visits
2002289514,408295,2018-10-01,5,"I absolutely love making this recipe, and we definitely double the seasoning to the rice, except the salt:) Quick question! We're moving over to brown rice. Is there anything we should do differently in terms of water and timing?"
2000377661,102718,2018-10-01,4,"Needed seasoning when hubby brought home ground turkey instead of sausage. Worked pretty well despite not having fennel. Too salty for our taste, and that was with cutting some back per a review I read. Next time I might try it with half the amount and work from that point. Will be using this again though and appreciate the recipe!"
2002289570,247715,2018-10-01,1,Cooked as directed. 425 oven that I then turned down to 200. I cooked it longer (4 1/2 hrs) and the roast was still raw. Had to put it back in at a higher temperature for another hour and it still wasn’t “fall apart”
1749202,330734,2018-10-01,5,I absolutely LOVE this recipe! It always comes out perfectly moist &amp; the skin nice and crisp. I’ve made it at least a half dozen times and didn’t have to change a thing except the length of time to roast it since I use a 5+ lb. chicken. Thank you! :) :)
2002289421,516908,2018-10-01,5,I've made it too..been buying it for years sometimes they forget the gorgonzola too lol..however at 8.99 a pound ..id rather make it myself
2002289460,82945,2018-10-01,5,"Great recipe! My nephew and I had a great time making halloween cookies with this. Just a reminder to those not satisfied, it's always ok to use your hands to bring your dough together and chilling makes for easier rolling and better shapes."
2002289618,139499,2018-10-01,0,For those who prefer to use dried cranberries/craisins: Use about 1/2 to 2/3 c. of craisins and let them plump up a bit in the orange juice called for in the recipe. They are available year-around.

2002289598,417056,2018-10-01,0,"Love these potatoes. First had them at Deanie's Restaurant in New Orleans. The serve them as soon as you sit down. Your recipe is terrific. I do add 4-6 cut up celery sticks and quartered spanish onion once boiling commences. Serve potatoes and veggies in a large bowl with melted butter. For a complete meal I add sliced Black Forest ham. What a meal!! But it all starts with the beautiful, tasty crab-boil potatoes. Thanks so much, and I'm going to prepare this meal right now. Cheers from Canada."
2002289387,205890,2018-10-01,5,"Im 15 so i havent cooked alot especially cookies... i was home alone and wanted to surprise my mom when she got off work cause she loves peanut butter cookies and i found this recipe! They are soft, chewy and amazing tasting! 10/10 recommended and very easy to make! FYI i added 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp vanilla flavoring"
2002288869,97496,2018-10-01,4,"I was craving sugar cookies but thought of snickerdoodles and found this recipe. Store was closed and didn't have any cream of tartar. Looked up that lemon juice or vinegar could be used as a substitute that actually worked very well, so I decided to make it. I was surprised that it didn't call to cream the butter and sugar, so I resisted doing that. I added 4 tsp of lemon juice with the wet ingredients. I mostly chilled the dough and the pan. I baked it for about 15 mins. They came out nice. Cruchy on the bottom but soft and chewy on the inside. It was a little not as flavourful as I wanted but it was good. Found that it had a odd egg flavor. Made maybe 28 cookies. They were eaten up quickly."
2001480472,254568,2018-10-01,4,"You can also use onions or lemons or both , sliced to raise the chicken off the bottom."
2002289537,92871,2018-10-01,0,Great idea for a quick meal we added some what's this
198154,218084,2018-10-01,5,My potatoes took a lot longer to bake than 45 minutes. I used 1% milk in the the lesser amount called for. I also used the reduced fat blue cheese. Once the potatos were restuffed I covered them with foil and put them in the fridge. (The potatoes took so long to bake that my starving family already ate by the time I had reached this point.) The following night I heated the oven back up and popped the potatoes in while making the chicken. I used extra garlic and garlic salt for the salt amount (can you tell we like our garlic here) and the full amount of Anchor Bar wing sauce. The vegetarian in our family just had the stuffed potato with wing sauce drizzled on it. Five stars is hard to get from my family. But everyone really liked these. Even Blue cheese hating DD!
489929,26773,2018-10-01,4,"Tasty... It's cold and I wanted to warm up the kid! Easy to do, I added an extra teaspoon of chocolate (Hershey's Cocoa Cocoa). Not sure if I should have done that daughter then said it was to much chocolate. Something to play around with to find the right taste. I added marshmallows on top. *****If you make this and really like it note the Chocolate that you use. I would like to try a different chocolate. I didn't use Aldi Hot Cocoa Cocoa because it has such a bitter taste.****"
2002289209,2886,2018-10-01,5,"Favorite recipe for work coworkers or just my boyfriend. Everyone eats this so fast, I can sometimes not manage to save myself a piece! I only put in 2/3 cup sugar, and also add in 1/4 cup chocolate chips, and 2 tablespoons of chia seeds. The chia seeds are completely hidden, which is nice. Add them in there for their micronutrients. SUPER moist. I do 4 bananas. Best variation I have ever made."
77850,451433,2018-10-01,4,I really liked this one. It's different. Cut the baking time down for sure.
1973434,536226,2018-10-01,4,"Fantastic, made it in an instapot. Very flavorful and full of goodness. Did not use the flour to make this Paleo. Even better the next day. Freezes beautifully."

2001362355,193430,2018-10-01,5,Wonderful combination of tastes! This would be especially satisfying on a cold winter day. I was out of sage and don't use bouillon because of the MSG but was cooking chicken for another recipe and used the chicken broth that had sea salt and onions in with the chicken in place of the water.
198154,341422,2018-10-01,4,"Good dip recipe as is, but it's a little heavy on the mayo flavor. Next time I think I'll try using 1/3 cup mayo and 2/3 cup sour cream."
1803370399,22176,2018-10-01,5,I've made many baked ziti recipes and never liked one enough to repeat it. This is the perfect recipe I was looking for. So fast and easy. It will be my substitute for lasagna when I want something easier. I didn't alter the recipe at all.
2002289073,89609,2018-10-01,5,"Great recipe! Although, you forgot the Old Bay seasoning. Definitely fry them. I fried them at 400 degrees for just about a minute on the stove top. A regular counter top fryer does not hold the heat the way you can create on the stove top. Pulled them out when I saw the color of the crust was perfectly light to medium brown. This way you get a good crust on the outside of a creamy flavorful inside. Oh, and try and get crab meat that is not pasteurized."
2001135884,133751,2018-10-01,5,This recipe is perfect. Most times I have to double it for a family of 5.
2002289192,31750,2018-10-01,5,Absolutely awesome. Here's the crazy thing...I forgot they baking powder. I have never had such delicious- melt in your mouth waffles!! Thin... crispy...buttery. incredibly delicious!!

23267,157475,2018-10-01,5,"This bread is simply amazing, though I made some changes. I used a whole 15oz can of Libby pumpkin -which gave it a strong pumpkin flavor that was divine. I also used cake flour for a softer crumb (1c 2tb cake flour = 1 cup ap flour). I also added more cinnamon &amp; pumpkin pie spice instead of straight nutmeg. I then added a chopped up granny smith apple which was nice, but would like to try it with-out next time. I will definitely add this to my treasured recipes and make it every year. Super delicious!!"
2002289459,62092,2018-10-01,5,I have made these twice now. My wife said they r by far the best brownies she had ever had in her entire life. I add a cheesecake swirl to mine. So nummy. I love to cook n bake

2002288996,2886,2018-10-01,1,"The consistency, colour and appearance were perfect. I have never given a recipe a 1 star review. Until today. The flavour - what an awful aftertaste!! A full can of Pepsi couldn’t even wash it away - salty and bitter, really weird. Not sure why either - nothing in the recipe gives that flavour... terrible. Sorry :’( ended up binning the whole lot after one bite..."
2002288866,247394,2018-10-01,5,I used sour cream and added some chopped mild jalapenos. It is DELICIOUS! Best corn bread I ever ate. The sour cream gave it a wonderful tang. Will be making it again!

2002287547,57830,2018-10-01,4,This was really good. The only changes I made was to add a cup of frozen mixed vegetables as well as cooking the barley separately and rinsing it before adding. I find when the barley cooks in with the soup it becomes too slimy.
2002289185,321760,2018-10-01,0,Loved the muffins. I too would double the cinnamon and nutmeg.
2002120722,28768,2018-10-01,0,Would never add dried oregano to a pasta sauce recipe. Oregano is in my meatball recipe - once stirred my sauce forgetting I had the meatballs in the sauce. Broke them up - it ruined the sauce.
2002287866,489644,2018-09-30,5,Excellent texture. Crispy on top and moist in the middle. I added lime zest and white chocolate chips with a lime buttercream frosting. Other than that followed the recipe to the T.
2002288318,206070,2018-09-30,0,"The recipe doesn't say whether to pre-soak the navy beans or not. I decided to live dangerously and not pre-soak. I cooked the soup longer than the recipe said to (nearly 6 hours on high and an additional 2 hours on low) and found the beans were still a little on the crunchy side, so next time I'll pre-soak. I did not use celery and I used a chicken bouillon cube rather than chicken broth. The soup was good: very little work, inexpensive to make, tasty, and filling. I'll definitely keep this recipe in mind for future use."
2002287876,436332,2018-09-30,5,wow amazing! first time I have made them and they are delicious! not too sweet nice and &quot;fluffy&quot;. will definitely be making more! thank you for sharing this great recipe!

2002044878,267289,2018-09-30,3,It was moist. It was easy. But it lacked flavor.

2001437224,92096,2018-09-30,5,This recipe is amazing! I grew up with an Italian Grandmother making a big pot of Gravy every Sunday.. She passed away when I was a teenager and I have always tried to figure out her recipe but something was always missing it did not taste like her gravy. Then I found this recipe and all along the one thing I was always missing was the cloves. Took me back to my childhood! I did use brown sugar instead of regular sugar. I also added half a small can of tomato paste while to onions and garlic (I used 4 cloves) are sauteing (it brings out the flavor) then I add everything else. With the empty can of tomatoes fill about 1/4 way full with water mix the rest of the tomatoes with it and put in pot. This is the best Sunday gravy! I do make mine with his meatball recipe which is amazing and I also add raw sausage to the pot as well. and I let it simmer all day. This is an amazing Football Sunday meal!
2002288613,212000,2018-09-30,0,Only one table spoon of salt?
2002288620,335244,2018-09-30,5,"This is a great recipe. I made it with the oven crisp chicken wings recipe and it was a great combo. Had to substitute the corn syrup for honey, as I didn't have any and it tasted great. Thank you!"

2002288408,151060,2018-09-30,5,"Just made this. So yummy-didn't even need the butter! I had pineapple rings already, so I just pulsed the can full in the blender for a few and it worked perfectly. :D Thanks so much!"
2002288441,183081,2018-09-30,5,"I tried this with a few modifications. First, cutting this recipe into eight pieces created buns about the size for 1/3 pound hamburgers. Second, I allowed them to rise for a full 25 minutes, because I wanted lighter buns. Twelve buns would be good for sliders or small hamburgers. I WILL make these again. FYI, I will be trying these variations: Substitute in 1/3 part sour dough starter for some of the flour to see if they preserve on the counter longer. Next, I will try making this into small sandwich loaves. Last, I am going to try to add butter and an egg and make a looser dough and create English Muffins. Thanks for posting the recipe, this dough has all kinds of possibilities. GrandpaCooks DOT com"

2438830,477777,2018-09-30,4,"Husband is allergic to onions so I added more garlic, no coriander on hand, so added a pinch of chili powder. Delicious!"
2002287955,247938,2018-09-30,5,"I loved this recipe! the honey butter mixture turns into a caramel. I added Hungarian hot paprika for spice and a dash of ground ginger and it turned out fabulous. Also, I used way more butter than this says you should. I love butter."
2002288324,59559,2018-09-30,4,"Won't lie, I added about half a cup more buttermilk, a half package of the seasoning, and it was perfect. We wanted it closer to restaurant style, which is thinner. Otherwise, great amount of mayo and sour cream to keep it from being too strong of a flavour for those 2. Other recipes call for WAAAAAY too much mayo."
2002168338,277860,2018-09-30,5,This recipe is great! I’ve been baking bread every other day or so since finding it.
2002288758,12591,2018-09-30,0,Turned out very nice but I must’ve measured the sugar wrong. Its a bit bland but powdered sugar on top did the trick for the first time. So fluffy

2002288790,366948,2018-09-30,1,Way too spicy and vinegary tasting (assuming from the Worcestershire sauce). Everyone hated it.

2000854795,9272,2018-09-30,5,I've made this recipe several times. It is my &quot;go to&quot; recipe for salsa. I sometimes add a can of kernel corn and a can of black beans (rinsed). So far I haven't come across anyone that doesn't really like it.

46039443,413116,2018-09-30,5,"This is a simple, flavorful recipe and is easily adaptable to 1 or 2 people. As a single man with an undying taste for the melange of favors in pan of paella, I was pleasantly surprised to locate this recipe after watching an old episode of “Throwdown” with chef Flay. He beat Bobby with this and now I know why. Try it."
2002288574,393491,2018-09-30,2,Super easy to follow recipe thank you for that. We got hit by an early frost here in Nova Scotia (not uncommon) and I was excited to put the green tomatoes to use. Disappointed that it turned out pretty bitter. Any ideas why that might be? Only modifications I made: no cilantro and accidentally put 2tbsp of sugar instead of 2tsp.
2002288768,471305,2018-09-30,5,EXCELLENT! NFL party- wing dip contest and I won 1st place out of 12:) will be making many more times to come.
10623027,26110,2018-09-30,0,I had to bake a bit longer...13 minutes but these are delicious! Love cutting them into squares so the dough is not overworked and there is no waste!!!
717221,2072,2018-09-30,5,"Easy and so tasty. Didn't pre-bake crust as others suggested. have added a little pineappple or strawbs as others suggested just because I had leftovers, but also made with just rhubarb. Have used treacle (soft dark brown) sugar in the crust for added yumminess. This is a recipe for the ages -i will use it over and over again. I cannot believe how few people know about rhubarb - it is a blessing from nature in my opinion."
2002094624,177031,2018-09-30,5,"I made this according to the recipe the first time. It was good. The second time, I made the tweaks as I listed. It was even better! Tweaks: I used vegetable oil instead of butter, half brown and half white sugar, all purpose flour with a small amount of coconut flour. I doubled the recipe, but I felt that I didn't have enough banana pur&eacute;e, so I opened a can of sliced carrots, mashed those, and added to bananas lol! It was delicious!"
2002054054,51883,2018-09-30,5,"I have made a variation of this dessert for years and everyone always loves it. I always use french vanilla pudding and put a layer of sliced strawberry's &amp; banana's on top of pudding, crushed pineapple, cool whip and then sprinkle with crushed pecans on very top and if desired add few sliced strawberry's on top with the pecan's. It's always gone within minutes."
2002287311,48760,2018-09-30,4,"Lovely recipe, will make again!"
2002287428,224960,2018-09-30,5,This was amazing! The pork chops were cooked perfectly. The sauce was very flavorful. Served over cauliflower rice. Even my non-keto husband at it that way and the sauce was awesome.
482376,517573,2018-09-30,5,"Oh my, was this ever good! The pork chops were tender and the sauce was so flavorful!! I cut down the amount of onion (1 onion) and bell peppers (3/4s of each) and still felt like there was plenty to go around. I loved the flavor combinations. Thank you!"
2002288035,188253,2018-09-30,5,This is a very good and moreish recipe. Like HawaiianBaker I took some liberties but nothing seemed to break. I veganised it using: 170g oil 2 cups wholemeal flour instead of 1/1 white/wholemeal coconut sugar + splenda instead of sugar 2 tbsp flax meal 5 tbsp wtaer instead of 2 eggs soy milk 1 cup muesli instead of 2/3 cup muesli 1/3 cup flax Would totally love cinnamon.
2002288196,101954,2018-09-30,5,Delicious..my boyfriend and I ate it in one day????????
2002288697,393491,2018-09-30,5,This is my first year with a garden and I had a lot of leftover green tomatoes. I was so happy to find this recipe. Made it today and everyone loves it!!! Going to can more tomorrow.
1076580,231701,2018-09-30,5,Absolutely Delicious!!! I made one slight change. I used 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Turned out perfect!!! Will most definitely be making this again and again!
2002287907,101954,2018-09-30,5,
2002213989,40497,2018-09-30,5,this is my new wings recipe! they turned out perfect! crispy without being overdone
2002287903,15839,2018-09-30,5,"This is the best dip ever. Adding real lobster is the way to go. I also add chopped shrimp. When I make it with these ingredients instead of using canned crab, it tastes just like Jack Astor’s dip. I simply love it."
2002288498,501127,2018-09-30,0,I'm Making this today.....
2002288479,54351,2018-09-30,5,How refreshing to find a recipe that turned out perfectly as written!! This is a DELICIOUS cookie and very easy to make. Will be making again....and again!!!
2002287637,264483,2018-09-29,5,Added chopped walnuts to the Strudel topping and a thin layer of caramel under the apple filling.. Absolutely amazing
2001718649,157841,2018-09-29,5,
2002287483,131018,2018-09-29,5,Made this exactly to recipe except I make my own Barbeque sauce instead of Sweet Baby Ray. Have served it a few times and get great reviews!
2002287523,90040,2018-09-29,0,This recipe is great. I grew up having this with peanut butter frosting(with a spoon of hot coffee to mix it well) . Still my favorite.
2000302327,499315,2018-09-29,5,I am going to try this recipe today. I will come back later with my review on these cookies. They look tasty. When I make my cookies I do not add the salt. Since I am trying to cut down on the salt. I was going to try frozen cherries in them too. I hope they come out good.
2000842857,63071,2018-09-29,5,"These are absolutely awesome! My husband travels for business alot and really loves the Belgium Waffles that are served at the hotels. Plus, I added 1/2 cup of our own fresh blueberries as well. My search has ended for the perfect Belgium Waffle recipe !"
2002287073,9270,2018-09-29,0,"Used Stevia in place of sugar, girlfriend had gastric bypass and this makes a perfect snack"
2002287534,193689,2018-09-29,5,This is awesome. Made homemade Pico de Gallo. Put on top of spaNish rice and black beans. So good. I like some sliced avacado with mine. You must try it. So easy to make.
296085,520872,2018-09-29,5,Easy and delish. I added some french fried onions to the topping. Thanks for posting!
2002287311,505086,2018-09-29,5,"I didn't have all the ingredients and wanted to have a filling lunch so I mixed the recipe up a bit but really love it. I didn't have apricots or dates but an apple I needed to use. So I added that one, toasted some almond slivers and fried some chicken with more sesame and spice mix. I halfed the recipe since I am not making family meals but I am now happy to have this meal for today and tomorrow. Will make it again!"
2002287196,49737,2018-09-29,0,why did you add chicken bullion though? its a vegan dish?
2002287395,117532,2018-09-29,5,"A very easy recipe...added a lil wheat,oregano n herbs to it..super soft n crispy...a hit in my family...we luvdddd it...thnx a lot dear.??????"
2002287208,144818,2018-09-29,0,What can I use to substitute for the wine? thia
1727508,393010,2018-09-29,0,Made this cake last week and it turned out great!!! I followed the recipe exactly as written. My family devoured it. This cake has definitely become one of my regular recipes now.
2002064591,342026,2018-09-29,0,Sounds good?
2002275741,177821,2018-09-29,5,"This is DKM's recipe from pizzamaking.com, copied without the crucial instructions and commentary. The amount of water is correct; the amount of flour is approximate. The correct ratio is 3/4 cup water, 1 pound of high gluten (bread or pizza) flour. Mix as directed. My KitchenAid has a J style dough hook, and I've found that the paddle works better. The resulting dough will be shaggy and may have a bit of dry flour remaining. Compress into a ball, wrap in lightly oiled plastic wrap, and refrigerate a minimum of 24 hours. This step is essential for proper hydration and flavor development. The dough ferments, it doesn't rise. Expect 30% increase in bulk. give or take. Remove the dough from the refrigerator an hour or so before use. The final dough is very dense, suitable for passing through a dough sheeter. It can be rolled by hand, but takes some effort. On the plus side, it sticks to nothing and has little to no snap-back. The recipe is scaled for a 20&quot; to 22&quot; commercial cutter pan; rolled out to 1/8&quot; is about right. Dock before dressing. Prebaking is optional, helps with crispiness if you use a lot of sauce. I bake dressed pies at 500 degrees on the lowest oven rack, or slide directly onto the grates of a fully preheated gas grill."
2002287318,347002,2018-09-29,5,"These turned out great. I added a little vanilla extract. Now, my question is, can I refrigerate the batter for tomorrow. It made a lot! We all enjoyed them."
2002287422,39087,2018-09-29,0,so good ohhh yummy!
1800118963,92096,2018-09-29,0,This exactly how I make mine. I also add a pork spare rib along with meatball and sausage. Sunday is not Sunday without sauce simmering all day??
2002287422,287093,2018-09-29,0,well wonderful!!
2002287090,97966,2018-09-29,5,"This is seriously delicious. I'll probably try variations with carrots, mushrooms and noodles but as it is it's wonderful. We had this for 2 nights and the leftovers were equally pleasing."
2002287108,192178,2018-09-29,0,This does not look like it is cooked at all after 40 mins at 300 not sure why but I put it back in. Did anyone else have this problem?
2002287744,437603,2018-09-29,0,"Yours look wonderful, paula!"
1233271,304982,2018-09-29,5,Made these for my very small wedding reception in June. I LOVE Tiramisu and these cupcakes were a great &quot;substitution&quot; for the layered dessert. I will make these again and again!
2002287407,74146,2018-09-29,5,"First time to use this recipe, with almond milk, and it came out perfect. I topped it with powdered sugar and warm blueberries and ate it all by myself!"
2001362355,110067,2018-09-29,5,"This was so easy and tastes good as well. I used 100% whole wheat sandwich skinny and sun dried tomato wrap for the base and used spaghetti sauce, so that had some seasonings. I added Italian Seasoning before the cheese. I cooked the sandwich skinny 10 minutes and the wrap 5 minutes."
2002287306,526984,2018-09-29,5,These pancakes are amazing. My daughter and I made them today and wow! Fluffy and flavorful. We used unsweetened almond milk/vanilla flavor and 1 cup organic flour with one cup whole wheat flour. She wanted chocolate chips so mixed in and she loved them.
2002287617,252178,2018-09-29,5,"I have made these twice! It’s so easy and healthy too; I made it with my kids both times and they loved the taste. The muffins are moist and flavorful even with only 1/4 cup of honey. Here are the changes I made, although there aren’t many: 1- I switched out the 2/3 cup walnuts for 1/2 cup chopped dark chocolate chips. I’m not fond of nuts. 2- I used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and NO nutmeg. 3- I added a pinch of salt. One thing I'd note is that both times, I got 18 muffins using my cupcake scoop, not 12 like the recipe says. And I baked them for 17 minutes. Perhaps this recipe makes 12 jumbo muffins. Thank you for the recipe!"
2001199319,35392,2018-09-29,5,"Thank you for this recipe. I actually get cravings for these now lol. Made some last week in my pan, they were great. Just made a batch of these using my deep fryer and they were AMAZING..I know that they should be made in a frying pan, but the deep fryer was a bit easier. Absolutely delicious!!!!!"
2002287683,88304,2018-09-29,5,"I’m also from Kansas and Made these for our Ocktoberfest party, the homemade dough was worth it, the only change I did was I used 1/2 pickled red cabbage and 1/2 regular which turned out great."
2000999552,535267,2018-09-29,5,"Thank you for this wonderful recipe. Its quick and easy and really good!!! We've used it over veggies, pasta and even made cheesy french fries!!! Thanks again!! :-)"
2001543318,46776,2018-09-29,5,i DO NOT HAVE TO MAKE THIS RECIPE TO SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT. IT IS BASICALLY THE RECIPE i HAVE BEEN USING FOR 50 YEARS. I COME FROM A MIXED/BLENDED FAMILY AND NO ONE LIKES ANYONE'S DRESSING BUT MINE.
2002287762,456285,2018-09-29,0,Totally disagree with the comment made about Mayo and fish. Mayo and Ritz Crackers on Salmon is one of my favorite fish dishes. Has an awesome complement to the fish!
2002064591,41882,2018-09-29,0,I first had this while visiting Rome. Unbelievable! You don't have to be in Rome to enjoy this dish
1717960,43806,2018-09-29,2,"I'm sorry, but I guess I am in the minority. It was extremely bland. I wasn't impressed with the sauce and the meatballs were okay. Maybe I did something wrong. I followed the instructions to a T. I am hoping that after sitting overnight in the fridge, the flavors married better. I cooked it for 2 hrs. Even my hubby said it seemed like I left something out. Maybe I am used to more Italian seasonings or S/P. I don't know, but I even bought San Marzano canned tomatoes, which are supposed to be the best. It smelled wonderful while it was cooking. I used to make my own sauce from an old cookbook from the 60s and it was great. I think the meatballs were fine. I really don't care for grease floating on top of the sauce. I did fry the meatballs and drained off the grease but there was still some at the top. I would use hot Italian sausage the next time. The sweet just didn't cut if for me. Oh well."
2002287643,194400,2018-09-29,5,This is a great recipe
2002287763,375370,2018-09-29,0,I have used this recipe a number of times. Never tasted the aluminium.
2002064591,49230,2018-09-29,0,There is nothing like walking into your home and smelling and all day cooking pot. Coq au Vin is perfect for this.
2001513219,96815,2018-09-29,5,"Wanted something sweet and this sounded a lot like French toast, so I decided to try it. I added maple syrup, peanut butter and apples. It was yummy and filling!"
2002286997,294941,2018-09-28,5,Awesome!!!!!!
2002286833,186256,2018-09-28,2,"I'm afraid I didn't like this receipt too much either. Smelled GREAT but chicken came out very dry, I cooked this about 6+ hr.s too, meat was starting to fall apart at the edges. Chicken breast in general are hard to cook and come out moist and tasty, I'm afraid this receipt does nothing to change that fact! ...My $0.02"
2002117089,135215,2018-09-28,5,Best I’ve ever had!!! Very easy to make. Used baby bella’s. Love them. Added little more stock as I don’t care for thick soups. Other than that followed recipe. Will make again!
2002044623,536547,2018-09-28,5,Everyone loved it. I like cauliflower so much I made it for me. It was loved by all. Will make it again during football season. Go Pack!
226867,511708,2018-09-28,5,"I love Greek yogurt mixed with stuff! This was a great combo - although I didn't have flax seeds, so added some sliced banana! (I know they're not remotely similar!) Forgot to take a photo, so I'll do that next time!"
2002286582,241330,2018-09-28,5,Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it. It was super simple to make. Thank you for a great recipe!
2002287000,34499,2018-09-28,5,"Came out great - very tender. I haven’t cooked pork chops in so long because mine always came out tough from pan frying them. I didn’t use egg or bread crumbs, instead I just seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder then browned in the pan. I baked a little longer than recommended because my oven is old. Oh I also added fresh chopped mushrooms to the sauce. Everyone loved it."
2002286471,243172,2018-09-28,5,"Robin, here's the idea I have that I'm going to try tomorrow. I'm going to include my potatoes in the crock pot with the roast, but once they're soft I'm going to remove them and then mash them, then make my gravy from some of the roast juices. That way the potatoes still have all that flavor from the roast!"
2002286635,154635,2018-09-28,3,This was just ok to me. I added vanilla and liked the flavor BUT I think you should use steel cut oats and not old fashioned. They get too mushy after several hours.
2001181163,99476,2018-09-28,5,Best beef and broccoli sauce recipe I have ever made.
2002286476,329804,2018-09-28,5,"This is great! I used goat milk and just normal beet-sugar and table salt. You were not kidding about it wanting to boil over, am glad I kept a close eye on it. Made hot chocolate with the dregs in the pan as to not waste any and it was perfect. Then used half to make frozen yogurt fudgesicles. Am really happy with the results, thank you for sharing."
2001981105,411501,2018-09-28,0,"haven't tried it yet, can't wait"
2002286968,196163,2018-09-28,5,"I have NEVER liked tofu, but I have to tell you that this is quite good! I tried it only because of the rave review and the fact that I just happened to have nutritional yeast in my cupboard. I bought the yeast over a year ago and never used it until I tried this recipe. I did slice it, drain it, and freeze it first, because I wanted it to have more of a chicken texture, as one reviewer suggested. I also cut down on the soy sauce and salt. It was was very yummy! Thanks for sharing!"
2002286519,105657,2018-09-28,3,"I increased the apple filling by a third after reading other reviews. Otherwise made these exactly as stated. They were okay but after taking them out of the oven, I decided additional tweaks were necessary. The dough itself was good and rose nicely for me. But even with the increase in filling, they still weren’t very “appley”. The fact that the cinnamon and sugar topping gets sprinkled over it just before baking gave it a dry sandy top, rather than the gooey glazed outcome that’s actually shown in the featured photo for this recipe. The first one I tried was a lot like a warm bread roll with a few apple bits in it and a bunch of loose cinnamon sugar on top. I actually ended up carefully dumping much of the topping back off and making a caramel glaze in the hopes that it would seep down into the rolls a bit and lend additional flavor/ moisture. Next time, I would either increase the apple filling more dramatically- at least double- or add some butter to the cinnamon/sugar mix and roll it up inside along with the apples, like a traditional cinnamon roll. Topping with the caramel glaze was an easy way to salvage this. I also decided to add some toasted pecan pieces for texture and they still turned out tasty. Oh, and I think I would roll them from the short end of the rectangle and have each roll yield six bigger buns than twelve small ones and adjust the baking time/temp accordingly."
2177754,314978,2018-09-28,5,"Amazing recipe. I followed it exactly. I have been trying to replicate the scones at Briermere Farms on Long Island for many years, since I do not live there and cannot have them often. This is the recipe. The only difference is size. I cut it into six separate wedges. Next time I will do only two or three to get huge scones. They are so delicious, well balanced, not overly sweet, and toasting them the next day they are just as good. Thank you for this!!"
2000793678,378778,2018-09-28,5,These turned out just great! I did not have any walnuts or pecans around so I just omitted the nuts. I also like to tone down on the sugar because I am not into super sweet cookies. They do taste like &quot;Grandma Cookies&quot;!
2002286602,35393,2018-09-28,3,They were okay. I wouldn’t make them again. They’re better if you’re looking for a dessert with not much sweetness. They’re fairly bland.
2002286721,152705,2018-09-28,5,Made this today but only wanted one for me so I reduced the amounts and did: 1/3 cup cold coffee 1/2 tablespoon sugar 1/4 cup whole milk 1 cups ice 1 1/2 tablespoons chocolate syrup I thought it was completely sweet enough without the additional tbsp sugar.
2002286911,155375,2018-09-28,5,"WOW! Just WOW!! It is EXTREMELY rare that my husband and 2 children like random recipes I find online.... It has been months since I cooked something new from a recipe online that my family actually enjoyed. Last night I cooked this per exact instructions (did add a tiny bit of worcestershire sauce per others recommendations) and it was a HUGE HIT!! This is one of the few recipes in my entire collection that the entire family said KEEP! Thank you, Thank you for sharing!!!"
2002286400,484564,2018-09-28,5,Turned out great.
2002284072,282073,2018-09-28,0,Just Plain pork rind do the hot pork rinds work too ? Wondering if the crust has a spicy taste ?.
2002286963,315187,2018-09-28,5,"Best meal ever! So delicious, cooks up great"
2001022199,78552,2018-09-28,5,This cake always comes out perfect for me.
2002286380,512009,2018-09-28,5,Happened to have some epicure lemon dilly spice so used that instead but omg this really IS a foolproof way to make salmon. I have made this dish 4 times now - perfect every time.
2002286615,25121,2018-09-28,5,I made this for my family about a week ago and they couldn't get enough. I am making again today. The flavor was simply superb!
565873,450153,2018-09-28,3,"I tried this recipe twice...first time was a disaster! Did not turn out well at all! Mixture was dry when making the crumbles, didn't cook up well at all. I've made more difficult Seitan recipes in the past with success so I gave this a second chance....turned out MUCH better! I don't know exactly what the difference was but this time it worked.Not bad if you want some fast wheat meat. Has anyone else fiddled with the seasoning and tried for a chicken flavor? If so, let me know how it turned out...would like to try that next."
2002286680,468588,2018-09-28,5,"Awesome recipe! I omitted the sunflower seeds, (kids aren't into them yet.). I sub 1/2 c of wheat germ for 1/2 of the flour. Excellent flavor; they never last long. Thank you for the recipe:)"
2002285241,63071,2018-09-28,5,Followed the recipe exactly for 9 waffles. They disappeared in seconds!
2002059355,536476,2018-09-28,5,"THAT was delicious, thank you! Normally I follow a recipe the first time, then write all over it to remind myself what I'd do differently next time - and I don't think I'd change a thing :-). I did cut the salt in half (blood pressure). Bonus for this recipe - I'm in the process of becoming an empty nester, and it's pretty difficult to learn to cook for two when you're used to cooking for 6. This was SO simple to reduce - I just cut up a chicken breast instead of tenders, and filled an ice cube tray with the extra coconut milk to freeze for another day. Well done!"
2000257420,31128,2018-09-28,0,"This sounds delish. I will definitely try; however in the reviews several people mentioned caramel, and I see nothing in the recipe about caramel. Is it drizzled with caramel after it's baked?"
2002286950,258844,2018-09-28,0,"1/2 tsp. of Tabasco is way too much! Would start with a few drops next time. Yummy soup, though, just too hot peppery."
2002287023,383872,2018-09-28,1,I should have read the reviews about the too much mustard!! It’s too over powering and ruined my whole batch! ??????
2002221961,19710,2018-09-27,5,This I definitely delicious. I've made it in the toaster oven also! Took one of my garden califlowers prepped to a family cookout and it was a hit by all. It's also good reheated in the microwave or toaster oven.
313633,206525,2018-09-27,5,"AWESOME BROWNIES I TOOK THEM FOR BIBLE STUDY POT LUCK AND EVERYONE LOVED THEM. WHEN I GOT HOME MY SON AND HIS FRIENDS ENJOYED THEM ALSO. THANKS FOR POSTING,"
2002285786,402855,2018-09-27,2,"Whoa there! 450 deg at 2 hours will scorch your food! Try, like, 320. Otherwise, it looks okay. I'd omit all the veggies, sear the steak first, add onions instead of powder, and use a lot of black pepper and a dab of butter once you braise it. And 1.5 hours might do it. Check then. The idea is for the steak to become tender, but to cook low and slow enough that your sauce does not scorch."

2002286330,33150,2018-09-27,5,I loved it! I brought it to work. Chris in grocery asked me................................... I kid you not every day. Did I make the pound cake. Or he'll see me and just say pound cake... LOL
2002285739,166059,2018-09-27,5,"I do not like Salmon. I only buy it because it is good for me, so I always have to doctor it, in some way. I gave this recipe a try to see if my daughter would eat it with me. She was still too shy, but it was delicious!"
2002286118,144652,2018-09-27,4,I think this is a delicious base with room for tweaking. My daughter loves the jars of alfredo sauce (yuck) so I was determined to make some homemade sauce she would enjoy. Everyone loved it! I never follow directions to a T but more look for a recipe I can use as a base to build on and this was it! For the first attempt I tried to stick to the recipe as close as I can make myself so that I would have an idea of how to play with it but it was good as-is (plus garlic... Because we love our garlic).
2002285688,200083,2018-09-27,4,"These turn down out delicious ! Perfectly crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle . I halved the recipe and also got about 20 cookies . My only tweak would be chilling the dough for about an hour , I find it prevents the cookies from spreading excessively . Will definitely be making these again ????"
2001847573,174723,2018-09-27,5,"I finally tried this recipe since I have a visitor coming soon. They are so delicious! I cut the recipe in half since I was just testing, but, WOW! They did not disappoint! Thanks ps..I always clean up once my muffins are in the oven...next time I will wait and brush the tops with the glaze once again!"
2001297534,137469,2018-09-27,5,Other than not peeling the potatoes and adding ground black pepper I made this recipe as written. The soup was easy to make and had a lot of flavor. Thanks for sharing.
2002286071,438883,2018-09-27,5,I've made this soup several times and it is always a hit with my family. Today I had to make a couple of substitutions...dried chopped onion and I also used boulion cube with water in place of the chicken broth. It stilled turned out perfect. Thanks for recipe! :)
2002286103,379330,2018-09-27,2,"I had all items fresh in my refrigerator and love each and every ingredient added but somehow didn't enjoy this very blah recipe. After we decided we didn't like it, we made brown rice, topped with Mexican sauce and added the stew. It was just okay. I have had something similar so I though it would be good. Disappointed."

2000498330,61812,2018-09-27,5,Delicious bowl of pasta with simple seasonings. Served as main dish with salad and bread sticks. Very satisfying.
198154,297465,2018-09-27,4,Everyone seemed to like it but DD liked it better without the cheese on top. I used a can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano in them. I also used a little less tomato paste than the recipe called for.
2000498330,41643,2018-09-27,5,Has the lovely flavors and smells of fall. Slightly dense texture with yummy raisins. Very happy.
2002285790,192346,2018-09-27,5,"Fantastic, went from struggling to pump 50ml-60ml to happily pumping 120ml+, have been recommending this recipe to all the new mums I've encountered with supply issues.

2002285788,19424,2018-09-27,5,Just made these for the second time and they are seriously delicious. They are arguably the best muffins I have every made. Both times I have made them with 3/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown because the first time that was what I had and the second time I wanted them to be just as delicious as the first. They have not failed -- I also upped the chocolate amount a fair bit! :)

57101,51716,2018-09-27,5,"Halfed the butter, used light sour cream and it was wonderful! It's now 2018 and I still make this recipe, as we love it so!!"
2002285749,348366,2018-09-27,0,"Mine has carrots, which should be cooked a few minutes before potatoes are thrown in. Rather than bay, I use fresh flat leaf parsley, about a half cup of leaves thrown in along with the heavy cream at the end. My dumplings are: 2c flour, 1/2c milk, 1 egg, 1tsp baking powder, and 1tsp salt - kneaded plenty, cut into 1cm strips with a scissor, then cut into 1cm cubes straight into the boiling pot. I also use Better Than Bullion. And my recipe calls for a cup of butter - there should be a signature golden sheen on top of each bowl of soup."
882197,127110,2018-09-27,3,"Being from southern IL we wouldn't call this bbq, but different areas of the country have their own tastes and flavors so I won't knock it other than to say it was ok."
2002285995,19213,2018-09-27,5,"Very easy to make and so, so good. I did make some adjustments: I added the vanilla to the rice as it was cooking so that it would absorb the flavor, I also added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and I did not stir during baking thinking I would get a thicker custard top. Thank you, excellent recipe."
2002286251,359390,2018-09-27,5,"Made this for my niece who just had surgery and a not great diagnosis. She requested it specifically and it’s never been my thing at Sweet Tomatoes. I followed the directions except fur only using 1 cup of pickle juice. This recipe made a huge amount, I gave my niece half and kept the rest for my husband and I. It is delicious and we cannot stop eating it. I didn’t even think I liked this dish and typically cannot stand dressing with mayo, but I love the flavors in this and the different textures with the pastas- although I’ll probably leave out the fettuccine next time. Thank you so much for posting this recipe, you made my niece super happy and we all appreciate it!"
2000127074,449719,2018-09-27,0,What is the butter for? When do you add it?
2002286041,192871,2018-09-27,1,"This is listed as sugar free, but there are a few issues. Both raisins and orange juice have high sugar. Orange juice saturates the sugars fast in the system so a diabetic could have issues eating this recipe...."

2002285989,145312,2018-09-27,5,Perfect Fall Muffins! As soon as you smell these muffins you will not be able to control yourself from eating these. Not only did these smell good but they were the best tasting Muffins I have ever had. I wouldn't change a thing!
2002285654,28954,2018-09-27,0,Can I just make the pudding without the bread
2002285828,276954,2018-09-27,3,"What Cheryl M. said about the Cimbru is 100% correct! Cimbru is a Romanian herb that is used in Mititei, my father is a chef who learned all his culinary skills in Romania and he always used Cimbru in the mititei. To get some of the aromatic flavour of the Cimbru use Thyme and Star Anise as that will give you a very close aromatic flavour of the Cimbru. I never use lamb in my Mititei, I only use pork and beef and never use beef bouillon granules. The rest is close to how a mititei should be done."
2000498330,297870,2018-09-27,4,"A hearty, filling meal. I think I would try with Kraft Deluxe Mac and Cheese next time, since that is my fav. Super easy for a quick weeknight meal."
2002285793,321642,2018-09-27,0,"You're right about eggplant - ANY low-acid food - needing pressure canning. HOWEVER, this is a *pickle* recipe. The 5% acidity of the vinegar preserves the vegetable without the need for pressure canning. All pickles are done via water-bath processing, except for crock-fermented ones. (also safe due to high acidity) Storage on a shelf is *after* the canning process. If you are still concerned, Ball has a pickled eggplant recipe as well - the very people making Ball Mason Jars. :-)"
2002232072,512088,2018-09-27,0,"It sounds like a good recipe, I can't believe there are no reviews after 4/12+ years. Maybe the recipe should have been halved or even quartered."
1102839,195452,2018-09-27,0,"To save calories, I used 1/2 recipe for a thinner crust. In the lemon mixture I substituted Splenda for the sugar. Very good and I took some of the calories out."
8679,11217,2018-09-27,0,"People aren’t being “rude”. They are simply trying to let you know that this recipe is NOT safe as written. Zucchini, onions and peppers make up the much of this recipe and they are LOW acid foods. To make this safe to eat you should use bottled (not fresh) lime juice. It is more acidic than vinegar and will bring the PH within safe limits. Now, just because someone has made this before and no one died doesn't make it safe. It is a bit like Russian Roulette. The majority of people live to tell the tale but one person dies. Is that a risk you would be willing to take with your friends and family? Don’t depend on the advice of non-experts. https://www.healthycanning.com/cowboy-canners/. Just because the recipe has been around for years that doesn’t make it safe. The science around canning changes over the years. If fact, using older canning recipes is not recommended. Here is a good article regarding making salsa with fresh lime juice. https://www.healthycanning.com/fresh-lime-juice-all-new-ball-book-of-canning/ There is so much trusted information out there it makes no sense whatsoever to ignore it in favor of advice from well-meaning strangers. The National Centre for Home Food Preserving is a good, reliable source https://nchfp.uga.edu/. Now having said all this I want to tell you that I just made this recipe and have made it in the past. Lots of it. I gave it to family and friends. I decided recently to buy a pressure canner as I’ve always wanted one. I started doing research to ensure that I can safely and I came across the information about some salsas not being safe for water bath canning. Everyone who got a jar of that salsa is going to be told to toss it. I can’t afford a reliable PH tester and if I ever made someone sick with my food I couldn’t live with myself. I’m not telling you what to do. I’m just letting you know that there is a risk of botulism with this recipe. Botulism is nothing to fool around with. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulism"
2002245832,165722,2018-09-27,4,"I modified it by saut&eacute;ing onions and garlic in the butter before adding the flour. Also, I substituted Old Bay for the cayenne pepper. Everyone loved it over steamed broccoli."
2002006749,133751,2018-09-27,5,I used this Teriyaki sauce on a Burnt Ends recipe from The Kitchen instead of the BBQ sauce (also had to modify the rub). Then we shredded the pork bellies for tacos (with a little red cabbage n slaw sauce). My coworkers LOVED this teriyaki sauce. YUM - and it's nice to know exactly what's in the sauces you use. This is a winner.
2002286265,316304,2018-09-27,4,I wanted a quick and easy cornbread recipe that didn't call for eggs since I'm out of like EVERYTHING and am making &quot;garbage&quot; chili tonight from leftovers. This recipe was easy enough and the cornbread looks and tastes okay. The bread itself is fluffy and airy. It did take longer than 20 minutes to bake the middle and could have used a little more salt but overall I'm pleased.
2001934117,295649,2018-09-27,5,"I made this today, i will be making it everyday from now on. LOVE IT"
2002286185,496992,2018-09-27,0,can I use the melt butter instead of the oil? or which one taste better?
2002285563,99476,2018-09-26,5,"Fantastic recipe, so simple and tasty, made more sauce than the recipe, to suit our requirements"
2002285103,199579,2018-09-26,5,I have made this recipe for many years but with a few changes. I salute the onion and celery before adding it to the mixture. I use a whole cup of milk and Cream of CELERY soup. I have tried it with the Cream of Chicken and it better with the Celery (in my opinion). I also use a whole cup of shredded cheddar cheese because that is what my recipe called for and I feel it needs the extra liquid. I top it off with French's fried onion topping or just a bread crumb/butter topping with a bit of parmesan cheese added to it. Be sure to use only the 6 oz. of noodles so it doesn't get too dry. My grandkids love this as did my children. I have used rotisserie chicken as well and it is just as good. (I use the juices in the bottom of the rotisserie chicken container and make that part of my liquid...adding enough milk to measure the 1 cup. That's it!
2002285551,351156,2018-09-26,5,I have been making this for years an its amazing!! I use garlic an herb cream cheese an its perfect!! Making it right now l..cant wait to eat!!!
1460111,536747,2018-09-26,0,"Very cute cake! Love the marshmallow pom poms. However, you'll never get 30 servings from a cake with less than 3 cups of flour! Maybe 10-12 servings."
2001229824,34499,2018-09-26,5,"this was so delicious! i'm not a huge fan of creamed soup in recipes but i'm so glad i tried this! i doubled the soup/milk so i had some extra for mashed potatoes. the pork chops were soooo tender, really perfect. this is a great recipe."
2002275992,31607,2018-09-26,0,It's baking right now but the dough was so dry. Are all the measurements correct?
2002285019,288988,2018-09-26,5,This is Great! I used one box of chicken bone broth and added water for the rest because I forgot to read and bought only one lol. I bought Bob Evans hot zesty sausage. It was all delicious. I would add a photo but don't want to connect my GB.
2002285344,60350,2018-09-26,5,I made 1/2 a batch for my husband &amp; I and glad I did. I did put extra cheese in there. It turned out really good! Will do this one again definitely. So much better than the boxed ones with the powder cheese stuff.
2002285062,83475,2018-09-26,5,loves the taste and its easy to cook. I get to clear loads of my Thai Basil from garden too. Thank you Grace for sharing the recipe.
2123645,190135,2018-09-26,4,"This makes one huge casserole! I'm not usually a fan of recipes made with condensed soups, but this one was pretty good. The mushrooms sauteed in butter is the crowning glory."
2002285145,98680,2018-09-26,0,"I personally thought this was delicious! I thought it taste just like my nanas cornbread !I was craving bread so bad and this gave me hope that i can remain strong and just say no, ill eat bread when im thin LOL thanks for this yummy simple recipe!"
2002284931,253865,2018-09-26,5,This was excellant..I doubled the recipe and served it as a main dish.
2002285295,438313,2018-09-26,5,I have made this chowder several times and have shared with family and friends.. We live in Florida but are from Maine originally.. fish chowder was a regular meal for us while growing up... this is the best by a mile.. the response from friends is that is just plain outstanding.. it's an easy chowder to make ................. we love it..
2588180,301002,2018-09-26,3,Way too soupy and too much pepper and salt.....for my taste...reduce the chicken broth to 1/2 cup and 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper total...1/2 of the lemon juice....
2002285033,137364,2018-09-26,5,This was Yummy. Thank you. I added all optional extras :)
2002285409,471295,2018-09-26,5,"This came out great. I used sage, thyme and rosemary. I also added garlic cloves and lemons along with some home made vinaigrette."
2002285034,192346,2018-09-26,5,Tastes amazingggg! Waiting to see the results!
2002284593,448958,2018-09-26,1,Doesn't look the same at all. The sauce if totally different.
1924722,223588,2018-09-26,5,"I made this tonight for my family, and they loved it! I made the Kraft Dinner as directed on the box, then added the taco beef (browned and taco seasoning added as directed - however, I only used half), and salsa. What I did differently was I baked it all up with some shredded cheese. on top :) YUMMM! This is so much better than Taco Hamburger Helper! Will make this again!"
2002285606,282620,2018-09-26,5,"I have been making a similar recipe for years now and I agree these are simple yet delicious recipes. The only difference is once the burger is browned, I removed it from the pan with a slotted spoon and I fry the diced potatoes in the beef fat. Then I remove them with the slotted spoon, put the beef and potatoes back in the drained pan with a cup or so of shredded cheese on top, and finish for about 5 minutes with a lid on the pan. I use salt, pepper and Lea &amp; Perrins to season the beef/potato mix."
2836476,274022,2018-09-26,5,This is delicious! Very simple and quick to whip up. My husband loves it. I think the next time I will substitute broccoli for the asparagus.
1122988,75984,2018-09-26,4,"The chicken turned out great! Didn't love the apples as much as I thought I would, they were okay."
2002284890,249713,2018-09-26,3,Nice flavor but needs more milk and eggs to fill the pie crust. I found the filling to be tasty but shallow in the pie crust - so it made a very thin quiche.
2001173194,185704,2018-09-26,2,We made this last night without changing any ingredients. We both love anything shrimp. We did not like this recipe.
2002284850,216778,2018-09-26,5,All of us loved it! My 3 kids ages 1 to 6 all thought it was delicious! It's definitely a keeper in my recipe book!
2002101259,253971,2018-09-26,4,"If you don't want to use a deep fryer, you can make this and bake at 400 for about 20 minutes, turning halfway through. It might not be as crispy, but it's still delicious and maybe a little more guilt-free. And I've substituted soy sauce for the milk, used Panko instead of breadcrumbs, and served with Chinese mustard. They disappear!!"
2001704911,190382,2018-09-26,5,Very flavorful! Thanks for sharing.
2000696829,146320,2018-09-26,5,"I love pomegranate martinis and have tried a few other recipes. I used regular vodka and Grand Marnier because that's what I had and it turned out delicious. I don't like my drinks too strong so this recipe was perfect for me. I do want to try it with the citrus vodka, too."
1965026,60350,2018-09-26,1,I made it just as written and it was surprisingly bland. I think I would have to double or even triple the cheese to make this edible.
2002285431,451868,2018-09-26,5,Oh my gosh this is the best recipe ever. Didn’t know what do to with all my lilikoi overload. I used half the sugar and it’s perfect. Yeah like the seeds left in for crunch and a little sour.
2002090888,56369,2018-09-26,5,This is so delicious. I let it marinate for several hours in a bowl with a lid and turned it often! It just keeps getting better!
2123645,479193,2018-09-26,5,This was an excellent meal! I did make some changes: made only half the sauce and used maple syrup instead of honey and garlic oil (husband can't handle the excess fructose). I used 1.7 lbs. chicken thighs and also added a teaspoon of ground ginger. Served over rice with steamed veggies. Such an easy and delicious meal - will make again!
2836476,59987,2018-09-26,5,This was delicious! I did chop the turkey a bit in my food processor as I don't like big chunks. The addition of the poultry seasoning was brilliant. I will totally make this again.
1686076,144970,2018-09-26,5,"This was wonderful!! It was super easy to do, left my oven free for other things and we loved it. The spouse absolutely raved about how good it was and how it was so nice to have cauliflower in a different way. Next time I might add a bit more mustard to bring out that flavor more but it was delicious as written."
1417944,66603,2018-09-26,0,Southern Maine native here.. Grew up in Otisfield and Sebago Lake Village and later lived in Portland as a young adult. Difficult to clone the original Amato's Italian Sandwich but when away from home I do the best I can. I've even tried to make my own rolls to get more authentic but haven't found the right bread recipe yet. The olives in the original are just plain black olives and there is no vinegar. It is a vegetable oil blend that includes olive oil. Otherwise the ingredients in this recipe are spot on. Bit of trivia.. our school lunch program use to make &quot;Italian Sandwiches&quot; on hamburger rolls when I was growing up. Same ingredients just on a hamburger roll.
482376,536990,2018-09-26,5,This fit the bill perfectly on a busy day/night. It was so nice to come home to a nice smelling house. The chicken was very flavorful and the bok choy addition was very nice. Thank you!
2002285417,119373,2018-09-26,0,Sounds extremely saulty
2002284537,483902,2018-09-25,5,"OMG, we've tried so many gyro meat recipes, and most are really labor intensive. This was the easiest and the BEST. It was so good, we tripled the recipe the second time we made it! This is a keeper! Make it, you'll love it!"
2002284805,361631,2018-09-25,0,probably means juice of 1/2 lemon not 1/2 cup
296050,211237,2018-09-25,5,"I've made this a few times, sorry I haven't rated before now. A great and easy recipe for delicious hot chicken sandwiches - I make ahead of time and freeze - that way when I have a party all I have to do is throw back in a slow cooker (after thawed) and reheat. Thanks Mrs Revpalmer for posting. UPDATE: I am asked to make this at every get together now, especially by everyone @ my church. I can't thank you enough Mrs Revpalmer for posting this delicious and super easy dish."

2002284362,338419,2018-09-25,4,Very good and very easy. The only thing I changed was I used the mini tots.
2123645,130308,2018-09-25,3,"This was an interesting dish. Very easy to make and very flavorful. I skipped the salt because of the olive brine and it was still salty enough. Not sure I will make it again, but it was nice to try."
2002284783,80675,2018-09-25,5,"The first recipe that I had, called for a bit of dry white wine, which I add and it makes it that much more &quot;special&quot;."

2002284147,254495,2018-09-25,5,"Lets start off by saying I love cooking but this is the first review I've wrote so far!! This is one of the first dishes I cooked for my partner when we first started dating, 2 years later I'm still cooking it for him! We absolutely love this curry! Any curry to be honest but this is one that stands out from them all, the flavors are fantastic and not what we usually cook with! Even my neighbour asked what was smelling so delicious!!"
2002283133,110479,2018-09-25,1,"Too sweet for one thing,before frosting was added! Also, cake mix is overpowering flavor of fruit and other ingredients and cake is very crumbly. Will stick with home baked version. Very disappointed."
2001176555,302476,2018-09-25,5,Super easy and delicious! Only difference was I added hard boiled eggs. Can you freeze leftovers?
2002226732,2886,2018-09-25,5,I had bananas in the freezer that had turned. They slid right out of the peel when thawed and were very seeet. The best banana bread I have ever made! I used the 4 bananas and vanilla as per the recipe.
2002284660,118242,2018-09-25,0,This is the best brownie recipe ever!!! I use walnuts and chocolate chips (dark chocolate). The beauty of this recipe is that you make it in one pan on the stove. I baked it until the sides were barely pulling away. If you like super moist fudgy brownies - this recipe is for you - Elaina -
2002283993,373296,2018-09-25,5,"I love bushwhackers! We live in Pensacola, Florida and visit the Sandshaker when we go to the beach.....yummy!"
2002284710,118438,2018-09-25,3,"I followed it to the letter, but I must have done something wrong because mine, on a lemon meringue, ?????? weep. I was so disappointed as I was hoping this was finally the one recipe that I would be able to count on not to. I think I will just have to give it another try. I doubled the batch as my lemon pie custard takes six eggs and I was reluctant to waste the whites and didn’t have time to make small meringues."
2002284440,54351,2018-09-25,0,Everyone loves this recipe! I use one cup quick oats &amp; one cup regular oats. Perfect!
2002284615,96521,2018-09-25,3,"Its a fast baking bread and definitely moist, but its pretty bland. I even added extra banana and vanilla and its still lacking. I am making another loaf with some tweaks. Also, ingredients didnt mix thoroughly so I will be mixing by hand first."
2002284040,25745,2018-09-25,5,I added minced garlic with the water onions and old bay seasoning...omitted salt.... lastly STRICTLY followed the timing for each added main ingredient... EXCEPT for the sausages and shrimp... red potatoes were perfect and corn blended well with the sausages n shrimp.... 1st time making this and was a true hit!!
2002284021,192375,2018-09-25,2,"I visited West Virginia and had several Pepperoni Rolls. I was excited to see the recipe, followed by disappointment. Pepperoni Rolls from West Virginia are to die for. So Yummy, and obviously made with bread dough. It's a shame they didn't pick an authentic West Virginia recipe for West Virginia's choice."
2000775855,30967,2018-09-25,5,"Made this today served with jasmine rice (mixed in saut&eacute;ed mushrooms, asparagus, onion and garlic), roasted Brussels sprouts. It was AMAZING, my picky eater loved it as well and even asked for seconds. It was so easy to make, I prepped at noon and took a 2 hour break, I even had time to make homemade chocolate chip cookies then started dinner at 4:30, everyone ate by 5:30! Easy clean up too... this is all that is left"
2123645,65643,2018-09-25,4,This was great! I made the casserole with ham and used only green onions. True comfort food!
2002284039,153642,2018-09-25,5,"Best banana muffins I have ever made and eaten. They came out super fluffy. The shape is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. They don’t shrink or sunk even after it’s cold. Each and every muffin top peaks beautifully. I am in love with these. Not only they are candy to the eyes, they taste just as delicious as they look. Light, fluffy, and moist. I made a batch with mixed blueberries and dried cranberries. The other batch with cocoa powder and chunks of chocolate. They are made in heaven. I will recommend this recipe to all my friends. Or better yet, make some more to share with them."
2001183009,63104,2018-09-25,5,"Excellent! I used this for some wild mushrooms I collected and left out the dried mushrooms. Wild chanterelles, puffballs, etc. I used only one cup of cream. I will make this one again!"
2000794713,39087,2018-09-25,5,"I've made this many times, and it's fabulous. I've also occasionally made it with shrimp, and it's even better!"
2002284371,28768,2018-09-25,5,"Ok..some reviewers seem confused, unless the author revised the recipe I just read. One said it call for too much salt, saying shouldn't add to meat then more to cheese. I didn't read anything such. It calls for 1tsp in meat sauce, period. Also, many said it needs to be covered with foil first..well, the recipe states to cover it for the first 40min. I am not sure what those reviewers were talking about! I will say the paste and can of water tip is useful, as well as covering top noodles with just enough sauce to not dry out..but in recipes defense, it does say to cover noodles completely or they will."
2001948443,257828,2018-09-25,4,Turned out nice. It is moist and dense. I added a few dashes of nutmeg as well. I calculated this to be 5 Smart Points per serving.
2002284813,183702,2018-09-25,5,"This a match to the recipe given to me in 1966 by an aunt of mine. She used 2 cups of Kellog's All-Bran and 1 cup of Kellog's Bran Buds = 3 cups like your recipe. This is delicious and a healthy boost to breakfast with a cup of coffee. Thanks for posting! And, yes, there are many variations on line, but I like the original."
2002284628,63447,2018-09-25,5,My family loves this dish.
2002279920,120006,2018-09-25,5,This is the best zucchini bread recipe and it turns out beautifully after defrosting and baking. I have also added craisins and frozen blueberries and it is exceptional.
2002144249,180563,2018-09-25,5,We didn't have any green peppers but your recipe is how we always did it.
2001669764,42536,2018-09-25,0,I have been making this pastry for years and it never fails to turn out nice and flaky. The best part is that it is very to roll.
269213,348366,2018-09-25,5,YUM!!! So good!
2002284170,330734,2018-09-25,5,"The juiciest chicken I’ve ever baked. By using the olive oil and following the baking directions exactly, I ended up with a perfectly baked, mad juicy chicken. I didn’t have the spices so I had to substitute and use pepper, salt, rosemary, powdered garlic, all spice and half tsp of lemon pepper. My boyfriend was in heaven. He said it was the best chicken he’s ever eaten. I believe the olive oil rub and the 450 at 20 then lowering to 400 for 50 absolutely genius. I can’t rave about about how well it works enough. It was so delicious, I forgot to take pictures."
2123645,18647,2018-09-25,4,"I wasn't sure how this would come out, but we were pleasantly surprised. It was delicious! Although it's not the most attractive of dishes...I added a handful of frozen cranberries towards the end of cooking to add a pop of color. I used 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs and cooked on high for 3 hours. I also reduced the salt to only 1 teaspoon. The chicken came out to tender and flavorful. I served it over rice to soak up the sauce."
2123645,536643,2018-09-25,5,Very good! I've never had Thai Green Curry before and was very impressed with this recipe. I used Thai Kitchen brand of green curry paste and it wasn't too spicy. Make sure to serve with lots of basmati rice to soak up all of the delicious sauce!
10997,9272,2018-09-25,5,"I make this recipe, but freeze it instead of canning it. Excellent every time. M family requests some containers be shared with them every holiday season and as I usually have tons of tomatoes and so tons of salsa, I am happy to oblige. This year I will trying a twist of tequila and lime."
2002284346,137364,2018-09-25,5,It was great. My first time making white rice i followed all the instructions except adding viniger because i didnt have any so i added organic virgin olive oil instead.
2002284183,90674,2018-09-25,5,I love Denny’s French toast and this really does taste just like it! My kids said it tastes even better! I can’t believe I can now make this at home!! Thank you so much!!
2001856352,108936,2018-09-25,0,"For those allergic to coconut, beware! The powdered version of Coffee-Mate's 'French Vanilla' is made with coconut............. Found this out the hard way................."
2002284723,136057,2018-09-25,0,The published recipe has more cred and seems right. I just made it and 4 cups was the perfect amount.
2002284477,14979,2018-09-25,0,Excellent recipe. I substituted half the vanilla extract with banana extract
2001854466,454168,2018-09-25,4,"Mmmm, I used half the pasta (substituted high fiber) and parmesan for the gorgonzola. The whole family enjoyed this tasty, fresh dish."
2002102523,388506,2018-09-25,5,"Been making my version for years. Cr of Celery, instead of mushroom &amp; add an 8 oz container of onion dip! And the next day is even beter, if there’s any leftover."
2002284378,528649,2018-09-25,5,PLEASE post a video of this somewhere!!
2002284782,227391,2018-09-25,5,I did half the tomatoes add Rotel with other half.
2002150141,536583,2018-09-25,0,The puff pastry looks raw in the middle- maybe it could be rolled up a little differently with the puff pastry not as big so not as much is in the middle ?
2002283315,119460,2018-09-24,0,I have a very old recipe almost identical to this one. In reply to the cooking time question by ejohnchat (it wouldn't let me go under reply) the pears are cooked 30 to 40 minutes and then waterbathed.
2002283902,58488,2018-09-24,0,Mine is still cooking but I felt 14 oz of tomato was not enough. I doubled up!
2002252836,54715,2018-09-24,0,I understood the recipe. Or does not mean both.
2002283818,233555,2018-09-24,5,Love it and it even impressed some stew snobs. I do season the meat with salt and pepper before I brown it
2002283225,20242,2018-09-24,5,I made this sauce but used it on a pork tenderloin. It was a huge hit with my family. I will definitely be making this sauce again
2002283243,162213,2018-09-24,3,"I told myself when I was making these that they were going to be too salty. I was right! Self rising flour already has salt in it, so there is no need for more. On a positive note, these turned out exactly the way I used to make them. I like pecans in them the best, but like them with walnuts and choc chips as well. I will make these again, but will definitely omit the salt!"
2002161469,1356,2018-09-24,5,I chopped up bell pepper instead of stuffing and it was delicious that way too
2002214592,94674,2018-09-24,0,"Seriously have you ever tasted Hawaiian bread! This recipe does not even come close to the true taste, sweetness, and earthy taste of Hawaiian bread!"
732280,107786,2018-09-24,5,Save the juice that comes out of the ribs it makes excellent gravy
2002283859,333831,2018-09-24,5,"These are yummy baked donuts. Of course they don’t have the exact consistency of fried donuts, but if you use shortening, you’ll get a closer ‘feel’. I sprinkled roasted chopped pecans over the glaze too."
2002283538,390290,2018-09-24,5,Turned out beautifully creamy and not-too-sweet. I served with molten chocolate cakes.
2002283320,536098,2018-09-24,4,"Good recipe, I personally enjoy adding onion powder and garlic cloves"
2002283846,137364,2018-09-24,5,I used this as a base for garlic rice. I was finally able to make prefect rice! The vinegar really helped and my rice wasn't complete mush for once.
2001959949,131528,2018-09-24,5,Wonderful. No caveats...
2002283346,53057,2018-09-24,5,"Excellent recipe. I did not have Kirsch, so I omitted it, I used an oaky good quality Chardonnay and it was delicious. Next time I will make sure to have some Kirsch on hand to try it."
1049730,49230,2018-09-24,5,"I nixed the SUGAR- marinated roast in Pickled Jalapeno juice overnite, and added fresh sliced garlic in slits. Ate for dinner and bkfst, froze the rest in freezer bags for the winter. It is a great recipe!"
2002283687,35659,2018-09-24,5,"This was a great base recipe! I always modify things because I can't just leave well enough alone, lol. I substituted vegetable broth because I am vegetarian. I also added tomatoes, poblano peppers, and adobo sauce. I didn't have dark chocolate so used cocoa powder instead. I put it over roasted squash, black beans, and rice. YUM!"
2002283495,225645,2018-09-24,5,Only made the sauce to serve with some dumplings I made and it was absolutely delicious! Will try again soon with the noodles
2002283089,71720,2018-09-24,5,lots of compliments I did add some sugar and butter
2002282642,398514,2018-09-24,5,It was great! Very easy and fast. I liked the fact that I didn't have to pound it too much. The sauce was yummy and lemony.
2002283483,75389,2018-09-24,0,Dont know yet just finished making it looks good
2002283317,396343,2018-09-24,5,"Had a little extra honey in my container that I mixed in there. Was a little skeptical about how much salt and pepper was going in there, but it tastes amazing! Only added a tablespoon to my salad because the apple cider vinegar is such a powerful taste. Came out great"
2002283197,531469,2018-09-24,5,This is exactly how my grama makes it ???? love love love ??????
2002268659,30018,2018-09-24,0,I think the protein is off. 2 lbs of beef would render more that 2.6 grams of protein.
2002283545,192786,2018-09-24,0,"Looks Yummy!! I have made dates and sesame bars, which is a little different than this one. I will surely try this recipe!! https://www.chezshuchi.com/"
2002201971,34753,2018-09-24,4,"I've tried this recipe a few times, and I think you really need to make it higher hydration (more water) to work - following the recipe with the amount of water called for gave me dense, doughy bread (though it did taste great!)"
2002282561,86892,2018-09-24,5,It was super easy and very very good. Not too sure I ever made Fish that tasted this good before ever.
2001839831,454300,2018-09-24,5,It was delicious. I simplified the cutting by putting the whole squash in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. It made slicing very easy.
2000504144,399162,2018-09-24,4,"I didnt use eggs,but i added chopped onions to meatloaf. I added tomato juice in pan with meatloaf as well as carrots,peppers,celery!!! Made some mashed potatos with butter and I was in heaven...oh and i added red wine to tomato juice..ok so a drunken heaven!!!!"
2002283354,453141,2018-09-24,0,Can I use fresh turmeric if I grate it
2002283679,16705,2018-09-24,0,QUESTION: Can these be cooked on HIGH for 4-6 hurs?
2002283709,40497,2018-09-24,5,This has become my fianc&eacute;’s football Sunday favorite!
2001685306,227127,2018-09-24,0,To Heather Reynolds: Do I add water to the soup? Also how long to cook?
172396,86013,2018-09-24,5,"this was fantastic, Made this with fresh caught Snapper. I had a hard time getting the roux dark enough (probably due to my impatience) however it was still excellent and yes you will use a lot of pans. Paired it with roasted green beans and home made mash potatoes and threw the sauce on the potatoes as well. Will make again for sure!"
2002283366,513216,2018-09-24,0,Can I switch out vegetable oil for something else
2001992739,129926,2018-09-24,3,"This is basically like a midwestern version of Enchiladas Suizas. I like it, but it's very rich and could use more flavor. I think adding sour cream to, basically, chicken gravy is just too much. Especially with the cheese thrown in there as well. Also, flour tortillas tend to disintegrate when used to make enchiladas, so it came out as a somewhat homogeneous stew."
2000949191,286419,2018-09-24,5,"This has become my go-to &quot;chicken soup&quot; recipe. It's very filling, easy to make, and just plain tastes wonderful. I didn't have Mrs. Dash's so I substituted the same amount of Herbs de Provence, which gave the soup and nice, delicate flavor."
2000498330,470468,2018-09-24,4,A fun breakfast. I used ham with cheese on top. Would like to try with bacon or sausage. Sprinkle a little salt and pepper on the egg.
2000416450,119828,2018-09-24,5,Loved this! Didn't use the parsley. Added some sugar to make more like Miracle Whip but it doesn't need it. Used on salad and chickpea salad sandwiches. Awesome and easy! Will be used again and again.
2002283415,21761,2018-09-24,4,"I always make my brussel spouts this way for years, but discard garlic? No way! I chop it up and add even more. In this house, there's no such thing as too much garlic. loll"
1052873,164644,2018-09-24,5,This is really yummy pie. Good flavor of caramel and crunch of pecans. Made for 2018 football pool.
2002283480,289388,2018-09-24,2,"I tried this recipe, it is ok, it does not really taste like the east side mario dressing so do not be fooled!"
2002283466,82310,2018-09-24,0,Howdy! I’m planning on making this cake for a reunion this upcoming weekend. Does this cake need to be refrigerated? Thanks! Sharon
2002283091,397640,2018-09-24,5,So good.
2002283949,417234,2018-09-24,5,"Seriously, the absolute best halibut recipe I've come across. Perfect every single time. I get raves evert time I serve it."
2000838528,8972,2018-09-23,5,I'm happy to see this recipe posted with the flour based &amp; not Cream cheese icing. It's what my mother made for my birthday my whole life and I make for my kids &amp; any occasion i can come up with! for the cake i use butter instead of shortening &amp; And definitely use granulated sugar for the icing &amp; not confectioner's. There are a few unusual steps with this recipe but it's worth it!
2002042489,102674,2018-09-23,0,What can replace whipping cream?
2001913373,12975,2018-09-23,5,"Very easy, fast, delicious breakfast recipe! Thank you for sharing! This one is definitely getting saved. The kids loved it!! And I’m sure you could add many different tweaks to change up the flavors!"
2002282192,209764,2018-09-23,1,"I must have done something wrong because this tasted horrible. I used Namaste Foods Perfect Flour Blend. I doubled the recipe and split evenly between two 9&quot; round pans. It wasn't dry, but it was chewy and tastes like cardboard. The only person that liked it was the gluten free birthday girl. The rest of us couldn't eat more than one or two bites. I was so bummed."
2002281526,327707,2018-09-23,0,"Thank you for sharing this recipe. This is a treasured family recipe that my Mom handed down to me, I’ve passed it on to my girls and Daughter-in-laws since My kids request this for their birthdays instead of cake. We always called it “Miracle Cheesecake”. I’m shocked that I found it on line at all."
2002282085,239674,2018-09-23,0,Please don't forget the Berry Pie! Perfect way to end the Napenthe experience!

2002282503,160413,2018-09-23,5,Great recipe they looked and tasted amazing.
2002273609,68874,2018-09-23,5,Amazing!!! I don't have enough words to describe how good this tasted....for some reason I can't attached a photo ??
2002283057,69089,2018-09-23,5,"Simple ingredients, quick dish. I followed the recipe as is and it was very rich, so I may try the variation next time. I used fresh garlic. Packed with flavor! Will definitely make again!"
2002281981,392188,2018-09-23,5,"Hey Secret Agent, kddot here and man this recipe brought back some good memories. I too ate these babies in Middletown NY many many years ago. We would get these from Tony Boffas. A name Im sure you are familiar with. Little Jimmies , I think that it was by the race track. Any way great recipe."
2002256447,69407,2018-09-23,5,"SO GOOD!!! my new go-to banana bread, super light and chocolatey and the perfect amount of banana taste. loveeeddd it"
2001455494,79563,2018-09-23,5,"I have made this recipe multiple times. We don't each ham, so I get a few smoked turkey legs to use instead. Absolutely fabulous."
6811501,48260,2018-09-23,5,"It’s a cool rainy evening and this was perfect for dinner. I used a big whole chicken instead of breasts. It took 8 cups of water to cook the chicken so I increased the ingredients to make 4 pints of sauce. I picked and chopped the chicken, browned the onions in the butter, mixed in the flower and added this to the broth pan. When it was thick enough, I add the chopped chicken to the pot. It was delicious over crunchy golden brown cornbread."
2002282614,293836,2018-09-23,5,"I was raised in Worcester, MA where Hannah Kalajian first produced the Near East Rice Pilaf and it was superb. Since it has been sold, what is offered in the boxes today is flavorless. When I saw this recipe and looked at the ingredients, I was hopeful it would be as good as the original. Well today I made it and it was AWESOME! Just the right amount of Chicken powder, garlic powder and turmeric. THANK YOU SO MUCH!"
2001391500,92561,2018-09-23,5,Amazing...but every recipe I have tried from Genius kitchen always is!
2002282949,116725,2018-09-23,5,Very moist yummy cake . Not to over powered with alcohol . I tweaked it a bit by coating pan with sugar instead of flour to add a crisp and used apricot vodka instead of just vodka
2002168950,219784,2018-09-23,4,It was pretty good.
2002280732,39087,2018-09-23,5,Fabulous! Creamy and spicy.
2000959393,344025,2018-09-23,0,"For Sue K. who is allergic to tuna, I'd suggest substituting canned salmon or sardines and perhaps add a little fish sauce..."
2825389,173017,2018-09-23,5,"This is my family's handed-down recipe as well. I hate cornbread that has sugar in it or so much flour that it might as well Not be cornbread at all. Our variation on this recipe was to add about 1/2 cup of cracklins to the batter. My grandfather always had 2-4 pigs that were rendered each fall, and we had home-canned cracklins to use. While some southern and southwestern grocers (Kroger, HEB, Food Lion) carry cracklins in the refrigerated meat section, you can achieve the same results by crumbling some snack pork rinds (chicherones) into the batter before adding the bacon grease."
2002227280,173017,2018-09-23,0,"This is the same recipe as my mother-in-law's North Carolina recipe for cornbread. I love it. I do secretly add sugar (What can I say. We Yankees like it sweeter), and I have been known to put bacon grease on the bottom of greased muffin tins and baked it as corn muffins with this recipe. It is heaven!!"
2002282484,28077,2018-09-23,2,Sorry but I too found this too runny on the inside and tried to bake it a little longer. Wondering if you should have baked at 350 instead of 325. I put them in the frig hoping they will set up so they are edible. This isn't the best recipe for brownies but it was better looking than the one from Kitchen Nostalgia Cookbook....they were like sponges. Anyway not sure why they are so runny in the middle.
2002282560,173017,2018-09-23,5,It turned out Great! Family enjoyed it and the texture was Great!!
2000271880,108775,2018-09-23,5,I’ve made this a few times now. Excellent! Love the sweetness of the honey with the tang of the mustard. I use unpasteurized honey from local beekeepers. Makes a huge difference in taste. I’ve used walnuts and almonds and we prefer the walnuts. I always toast them first to enhance the nutty flavor. The first time I overcooked the salmon and it was dry and chewy. Don’t overcook!
2002072163,173017,2018-09-23,0,I already this will be delicious. This is the recipe my father used. Including the iron skillet!!! Already saved it!!!
400708,485843,2018-09-23,5,"I was a little leary about this recipe, but love the health benefits of Quinoa so decided to give it a try. It was so good, loved the discrete little pop feel of the quinoa and they turned out so light with just a hint of sweet. Even DH who doesn't appreciate anything new or different enjoyed these. Only thing I did a little different was seperate the eggs, whisk the egg whites until stiff before mixing them in the batter - also added a teaspoon of vanilla just because who doesn't like vanilla in their pancakes. Had a couple left over and have frozen them for a quick breakfast on the fly later."
2002283051,94210,2018-09-23,3,"I did not like the flavor of the sauce. Pretty boring and way too heavy on the tomatoe. However, it was edible and the ribs cooked pretty well."
2002282203,136487,2018-09-23,5,"I needed a dairy-free muffin recipe so gave this a whirl. Delicious and moist! I used a bit less sugar as i ran out, but am glad i did as they had a good level of sweetness. I also only used one egg (again, ran out!) and substituted a dash of extra oil... the recipe still turned out ??"
2002282373,19192,2018-09-23,5,"I had some leftover crab and the waitress suggested a crab omelette. I googled it and this was the first recipe that came up! Wow, I made it exactly as described and I’m blown away. It’s delicious! I served it with sliced tomatoes. Definitely making this again! YUM!!!"
2002282708,274450,2018-09-23,5,So good! Made it twice so far. I’m glad I found this recipe before I tried any others. I’ve been wanting to make my own blue cheese dressing for a long time. You simply cannot buy good blue cheese dressing. Make this and you’ll never want to have any other. The best I’ve had in years! I used less mayo and more sour cream (by about 1/4 cup).
2000653870,488069,2018-09-23,5,"I love this recipe! It is so easy and my kids love it. I made it just as is and it was great, but I might add a little more cornstarch next time to make the sauce a little thicker."
2001577875,482419,2018-09-23,5,It was really good....I added about half of a regular size cabbage because I didn't have zucchini and it turned our great. I also recommend browning the lamb for about 10 minutes before making the soup.
2002282414,267110,2018-09-23,5,"Used white whole wheat flour and, because the batter seemed thick and I prefer thinner pancakes, additional buttermilk, but the recipe turned out very well, light, tasty, and was very easy. I made it because I had some leftover buttermilk, but will make sure I have some in the refrigerator more often because these pancakes got a great reception and were not “unhealthy”. A solution for those days you want something special for breakfast."
2002282210,250212,2018-09-23,5,AMAZING!!!??
2002282393,366948,2018-09-23,0,"I just put everything in the crackpot,, i will let you know how it is when its done."
2002282380,110683,2018-09-23,5,I made the recipe as is since it was my first time and my husband and I both loved them! I may try and make a fall time version next weekend with some nutmeg maybe!
218535,210676,2018-09-23,3,Mixed reviews from my family
2002158890,158079,2018-09-23,5,"I made the recipe as is with these tweaks: 1. I seared the meat (7 lbs) in the oven on a sheet tray under the broiler for 10 minutes per side. In 20 minutes all the meat was beautifully seared and no mess. 2. I finished the dish by using an immersion blender to blend the cooking liquid smooth all the aromatics, carrots etc., whizzed silky smooth and shiny - then spooned over the ribs."
2002282968,165254,2018-09-23,5,Excellent. So tasty and so easy.
2001983446,205760,2018-09-23,5,Perfect shredded chicken had eluded me up until I found this.. as a matter of fact.. it was impossible.. but now? Tender shredded chicken is less than an hour and a half away!
2000431985,329341,2018-09-23,4,"THIS IS NOT A RECIPE FOR 1 PIE! You lost a star because your recipe is flawed. 8 Apples? I thought maybe I just had large apples. But then I made the crumble. Again that was enough for 2 pies. It was delicious. But if I would have had an extra crust handy, I would have been put out. But now they get to try a pie at work."
181957,433557,2018-09-23,5,"WOW! This was fantastic. I didn't have a few of the spices (savory, cardamom and vanilla beans). Other than that, I made it exactly as written, both with ingredients and techniques. I used 12 thighs and the flour mixture was almost the perfect amount. I only have fried chicken a few times a year and was craving it so this was a huge treat. Will make again and will try to remember to get the missing spices."
280271,482882,2018-09-23,5,I cut the recipe in half and had plenty for two...we are cutting down on our carbs so we had this delicious egg salad on lettuce...we both enjoyed the touch of dill...made for FYC tag game...
2002282672,197575,2018-09-23,5,Works every time. Genuine NYC hotdog sauce. Thank you!
2002282639,416708,2018-09-23,0,We loved this. I addd bacon and topped with cheese
2002282988,492571,2018-09-23,5,Simple and easy but looks like you worked really hard. I didn't have parsnips and added shallots. Cooking time may vary. I will definitely make this again!
52125,163482,2018-09-23,5,"These wings were awesome, thank you."
2002281992,99476,2018-09-23,5,Amazing!
42152439,342431,2018-09-23,0,I need to try this bought a package someone makes but its 9.00 and not many serving
218535,92095,2018-09-23,3,There are better meatball recipes on this site
2002283054,153642,2018-09-23,5,"So easy and so very yummy! I took the advice of the people who stated in other reviews that the sugar should be reduced to 1/2 cup, and I used brown sugar this time. Next time I think I might try it with the whole 3/4 cup or possibly try a mix of brown and white sugar. The fresh blueberries I used were rather tart so the extra sugar wouldn't of hurt but regardless they were great! I only had two med. bananas so I added a splash of milk and a splash of lemon juice. I also added the 1 tsp of Vanilla recommended by others and added a tsp of cinnamon. I freaked when I added the softened butter to the banana, sugar, egg mix without melting it first (Like a goof), but they turned out just fine regardless, just stirred until smooth once I mixed in the dry ingredients. Added the blueberries last to make sure they did not burst and only added about 3/4 cup instead of the full cup of blueberries. Seems like you can make endless tweaks and additions and make some great muffins! Will definitely be making these again and now my house is smelling amazing! These won't last long in our house!"
226867,171157,2018-09-23,5,"This was so good! I would used a can of chopped tomatoes next time - I had to add some water to keep the mixture from drying out as it cooked. It may have had something to do with my using chopped grape tomatoes, as that was what I had. made for your football win Sept 2018"
2002282369,106262,2018-09-23,0,Going to try them hope they will turn out delicious! Thank you
2002282816,391371,2018-09-23,5,"First I must mention that I thought I had rolled oats when I told my preschoolers we were making these cookies. Nope. Steel cut oats. I toasted them in the toaster oven, and the cookies turned out great! Soft, chewy and a lot of nutty texture. I did 1/2 cup toasted steel cut oats and 1 cup oat flour so the hard oats wouldn’t take over the cookie. Worked great. I also left out the white sugar. 1/2 cup brown sugar plus the raisins made them sweet enough."
2002282880,2496,2018-09-23,3,Use more water!! I used just under a full cup of boiling water and only cooked it for 30 minutes but it came out so dry and undercooked
2002282011,9272,2018-09-23,5,We are getting ready to make our second batch of salsa. First one was so good we decided to make another one while the tomatoes are still on! Excellent!
2001073865,32522,2018-09-23,3,"Eh. Not bad, but lacking flavor. Followed to a T and I have other recipes I prefer. Mostly just tasted tomato with an after of chili powder. Didn't even notice the worcestershire and I was sure I would."
2002283025,9054,2018-09-23,5,Yummy!!!
2002282484,36627,2018-09-23,1,Sorry these were not anything as pictured. They were not dark in chocolate color and the top was far from that. They were spongy and not very good. I think you need to up your cocoa to 1/3 c. and maybe bake them a little first before adding the cream cheese. 125g. is 1/2 cup which is 1/2 of a pkg. of cream cheese. I'm sorry they just aren't good.
2002136741,101018,2018-09-23,0,"Made exactly as directed, totally delicious. Next time would use a little more broth."
2002251821,154356,2018-09-23,4,"I followed some of the suggestions and used frozen chicken breast which I cut into cubes. I added pineapple juice and chicken broth to double the amount of liquid but only used 1/2 cup of low sodium soy sauce. Cooked on low for 3.5 hours. During the last 40 min. I threw in frozen broccoli florets, sliced onion and red pepper. Thickened sauce with a little corn starch and served over rice. Delicious! Next time hubby said to add a few red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. Thank you for this recipe- great weeknight dinner."
2002282854,494182,2018-09-23,0,"Looks like Franks and has the consistency of Franks but, using dragon cayenne peppers, it’s much hotter than Franks. I’ll probably cut my next batch with more vinegar."
2002282078,142524,2018-09-23,5,?? this! My momma still makes this and the &quot;cathead biscuits&quot; ?? Blessed indeed
2002281419,67930,2018-09-22,4,I do not know why some people are finding these waffles mushy as they most definitely weren't when I made them. I made these with homemade pumpkin puree and as a result I pulled back a little on the milk (I find homemade puree is not as dense as the canned stuff) so that may be the issue some are having. The smelled gorgeous as they were cooking and were so good with cinnamon whipped cream.
1800042015,58047,2018-09-22,5,AWESOME!!!!!
2002281210,447567,2018-09-22,5,"I used a 3 lb. boneless pork butt. I used 2 tablespoons of all the ingredients, mixed them together and after coating the entire roast with olive oil-I rubbed it everywhere, then the spice rub. I wasn't too sure about the cumin as it was cooking, it's a strong smell. I cooked at 300 degrees for 3 1/2 hrs. uncovered. I was shocked at the flavor. Unbelievable!! I was making it for pork tacos. But I couldn't stop eating it as I was chopping up the rest of my ingredients for the tacos...Perfect recipe"
418600,484134,2018-09-22,0,"Love it! Made it first time exactly as instructed. Made it second time and I added 1 pound of cooked breakfast sausage ( I used a roll of Jimmy Dean) to the egg mixture since I really love the sweet/savory combination. Will be making this often, I love breakfast at supper time and this will be perfect. Might add bacon or ham to mix it up for a change each time."
2002281591,102631,2018-09-22,0,"hi, what can i substitute the vital wheat gluten flour with? thank you."
2127223,277969,2018-09-22,5,This is exactly like my mother would make this.....today I just used regular tomato sauce and add some jalape&ntilde;os sliced and Mexican shredded cheese cause what I had . This is good for breakfast or side dish for dinner . Yummy!!!
2002281753,88364,2018-09-22,5,"Best lemon drop martini ever! Instead of super fine sugar, I use simple syrup"
2002281075,316418,2018-09-22,5,"Be sure to use bone-in short ribs. 3lbs of boneless ribs are going to absorb much more liquid than the same weight of bone in and the marrow that seeps out during the cook process is part of the success of this dish. The addition of a nice roux at the end to make a sauce is a good idea. Instead of getting rid of the fat, I simply used a wand blender to purify the liquid and let it reduce down a bit; the pur&eacute;ed onions absorb the fat. It turned out sweeter than I would have liked on the first go with this method, but you can always add salt as needed. I definitely recommend seasoning the meat ahead of time and i also saut&eacute;ed the onions and garlic in the pan the meat was cooked in after it was removed (maybe this helps... maybe it doesn’t). I’m pretty pleased with the overall result though."
2001665492,375067,2018-09-22,0,OMG that's so gross! lol Those slimy noodles in a tortilla! Starch on starch!
2000412941,34620,2018-09-22,4,"Enjoyed the loaf, though I wish the recipe had a little more specification in terms of rise time. I proofed the yeast and sugar separate from salt, butter, and flour. Added them after 5 minutes, with the rest of the flour. The loaf turned out well, and has a great crust."
2002281145,133550,2018-09-22,5,Really good and super easy. Never used liquid pectin before and it set really well. I will definitely be making a lot more. I didn’t grate the lemon peels either. Still came out great.
1800042015,57349,2018-09-22,0,"Would this work with brown basamati rice? I don't like to use white rice. Or white potatoes, bread or sugar. I know that those ingredients aren't in the recipe... I just wanted you to know the reason for my question."
2002280985,132263,2018-09-22,5,These Pancakes were perfect. Fluffy and great tasting.
2002281867,119373,2018-09-22,5,Followed the recipe and it was PERFECT. Thank you!!
2002281765,85057,2018-09-22,5,Best biscuit recipe EVER. I sifted the flour and followed the recipe and these biscuits were perfect. I also brushed with melted butter before baking. Very light and airy and better than KFC.
3493137,228458,2018-09-22,0,I followed the recipe quite literally. Not good at all. Too dense &amp; just not good. Husband said he didn't like at all either. Sorry.
2000502431,536465,2018-09-22,5,"I made this for my two roommates and myself and it was a big hit. The flavor of the scallions and chilies went great with the shrimp - I was worried that they'd be too sweet or tough from the extra cooking but they were terrific. I always make my own pizza dough - just 3C flour, 2tsp salt, 2tsp yeast, and water in the food processor, super easy. It's a bit labor-intensive to have to shallow fry some shrimp and then bake a pizza but it's worth it!"
2002281013,69173,2018-09-22,5,These are ABSOLUTELY delicious!!! I was in search for a good meatball recipe a while back and now it’s the only recipe we use! They are so flavorful and soft. My family loves them! Tonight we used half ground beef and half mild Italian sausage. SO good!
1800607536,53301,2018-09-22,4,I used Hersey's Sea Salt Caramel chips.
2001361121,154356,2018-09-22,1,Didn't like it at all. tasted awful.
12278285,126091,2018-09-22,1,This is Tyler Florence's recipe except you recommend much too long cooking time for the salmon.
2000155562,63484,2018-09-22,0,Why did mine come out a BIG MESS? Even after I chilled them overnight and for a couple of days. They still spread into peanut brittle thin. My butter was not too soft. R.M.
2002281200,63071,2018-09-22,0,"Best Belgian Waffle recipe you can make!!! We LOVE it!! Try it, u won’t be sorry!! Can add cinnamon , or can add blueberries or pecans or chocolate chips! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!! Will be a keeper in my recipe book!!!"
2002125934,83083,2018-09-22,5,This banana pudding taste just like the ones my grandmother made its great.
198154,137251,2018-09-22,4,"While DD and I weren't crazy about this sauce, it was to be expected as were not huge fans of A1. My husband, on the other hand, really liked it."
2002281847,115335,2018-09-22,5,"I read all of the reviews so tested everything at 90 minutes. Potatoes were done so removed them and added back 10 minutes before dinner. Used a pork Tenderloin in sections because that is what I had in freezer and still cut slits for onions. Used baby carrots, thumb sized, not the little skinny fingerlings. Everything was perfect and husband called it &quot;amazing&quot;. I used a La Creuset cast iron, porcelain coated, dutch oven. I don't know why others had poor luck with this recipe because a lid on a dutch oven holds in the moisture and with a can of broth, this should not turn out dry ."
2002281838,335709,2018-09-22,5,"Loved the baked. Also used the Italian bread crumbs, another variation could be crushed Cheez-its."
2002281442,135854,2018-09-22,0,This is ABSOLUTELY fabulous! A change from graham cracker crust. Everyone loved it! Thank you! ????
2001723481,431259,2018-09-22,0,I try not to use canned thing so I opted for milk with sources and broth of my own. Added everything else and came out great without all those chemicals from the cans. Meat was tender so good.
2002281055,203826,2018-09-22,5,Looks delicious!
2002089873,149493,2018-09-22,5,Great my Dad and my hubby love them.
2002281071,250325,2018-09-22,0,"First batch without tweaks was kinda bland for my taste. So I tweaked a bit until I got it right for my taste. Sage and chili flakes doubled, a pinch more Thyme, salt/pepper to taste. It didn't serve 4, only me. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
2654514,385925,2018-09-22,5,"These were amazing. Made them to celebrate a birthday/hiking victory and will be shared around the campfire in a cabin in Alaska at the base of a mountain! They came out absolutely perfect and moist and delicious. Not too difficult , but making them last till tomorrow will be a challenge????"
1800042015,400909,2018-09-22,0,I don't like the taste of evaporated milk. Would heavy cream work? Or maybe half and half?
2002281960,195723,2018-09-22,5,I’ve been making this recipe for years out of Celebrations on the Bayou! I didn’t have my cookbook and wanted to make it for game day. Thanks for posting it!! It’s our go-to hot dip!
2089043,14979,2018-09-22,0,"Just like I remember from when I was a kid! I did cut the sugar by a third because the bananas were very sweet. Also if you use a store bought crust, make 2/3 the recipe, or enjoy the leftovers."
2002127333,242338,2018-09-22,0,There must be some mistake. This calls for 5 onions (???) for 1 baguette? 1 baguette couldn't even begin to hold the quantity of sauteed onions that 5 onions would produce....
2001762585,486156,2018-09-22,4,I’ve made this twice. With few adjustments it’s perfect! I replaced 1/4 cup of water with lemon juice in the cake. I also added lemon zest to the filling and an extra teaspoon lemon juice. Also I used 2-9 inch cake pans.
2001028303,27509,2018-09-22,5,I'm from New Orleans and My Mawmaw used to make this for us every weekend. Brings back great memories.
175824,33489,2018-09-22,5,This is my new go to recipe. It is great!! Thanks for sharing. I'm making this again today. Yummy
2002281524,494182,2018-09-22,5,This is our new favorite sauce! We are a low sodium family and don't add the salt. And it is still delicious!
2002281178,123910,2018-09-22,4,The amount of milk equals 5 and a half cups. Which is right makes it creamy not dry.
2002276606,383868,2018-09-22,1,"I followed the recipe exactly as written, they looked great but were tasteless, I was so disappointed."
2002246426,343008,2018-09-22,5,"I made some last night! I thought, I had defrosted some ground beef, turned out to be some sirloin steak. I really wanted a taco salad, So I dusted the steak with some taco seasoning. (Should have used a touch more.) Think, I'll use chicken meat next time. Been making this for 10+ years. I normally eat with warmed refried beans and meat. I like with ranch dressing, guacamole, and salsa!"
2001564933,297856,2018-09-22,0,Yikes. 2 Jars of Alfredo sauce and 4 cups of cheese? Heart attack on a plate.
2002039866,449167,2018-09-22,4,"I found the recipe a tad bland, but I can see how it would go over well with a lot of people. My peppers were really small so I had almost half of the filling left over - I'm sure it would have balanced out of I'd had more capacious peppers. Overall, quite good."
2002229723,54257,2018-09-22,5,Had more ground beef than the recipe requirement by a third so I tweaked the ingredient amounts abit. It turned out FANTASTIC!! It's a keeper!
2002281506,1356,2018-09-22,5,"I don't think I ever completly follow a recipe. The only changes I made was I added a bit more worcestershire sauce, a can of undrained stewed tomatoes and a tiny squirt of ketchup. It is cooking on the stove right now."
2002281342,203062,2018-09-22,1,This was the worst recipe I have ever tried they were absolutely tasteless and flat very disappointed
2002281396,259616,2018-09-22,5,"I've tried this recipe and it is fantastic! You can actually use the oatmeal without cooking it for a slightly different texture. I would recommend if you are going to do that, that you grind the oatmeal into a fine powder in a food processor or blender first. It's definitely a winner and I am so saving this recipe. I did make a couple of changes to the recipe. These are the changes I made. I used full fat milk instead of 1% milk. I used a 5 ounce container of full fat vanilla yogurt. I used 1 cup of oatmeal (to account for the extra liquid from the yogurt.). 1 tablespoon of peanut butter instead of 2 teaspoons and a 31 gram scoop of chocolate whey protein powder. I also added additional ice so it came out the consistency of a chocolate peanut milkshake but you can definitely add less ice if you want it thinner. I made it this morning and added less ice this morning than I did yesterday and it was still great. To me it's almost like you are drinking a Reese's peanut butter cup milkshake."
2002281083,303890,2018-09-22,0,Amazing
2002157055,131639,2018-09-22,0,"If you have a pressure canner, it can be canned just the way it is. I don't have one so I would jar up just the blended tomato part, without the broth, add about a teaspoon of lemon juice to each jar and boil it in a water bath canner for 30 minutes. When you want to serve it, the broth will be added then. Hope this helps."
2002281043,138288,2018-09-22,2,"Followed the directions, despite my concerns the chicken and potatoes would come out dry. My suspicions were confirmed as the meal was very very dry. I guess the dog will be happy with leftovers tonight"
2002277439,53081,2018-09-22,5,My kids love this race pudding(sans raisins)! It's a regular after school treat in the fall and winter. And sometimes they enjoy it for breakfast!??

2002281891,417803,2018-09-22,5,"This is our goto dish, particularly late summer with all our pear tomatoes and basil coming up. One question, why add the parm at the end separately rather than just in the pesto?"
2002281243,410139,2018-09-22,1,"I'd give this zero stars if I could. Chef Jarrod is a big fat stinky liar. This is not the Diablo Sandwich that Buford T. Justice had in Smokey and The Bandit. Actually watch the movie and examine the sandwich. No corn, no lettuce, no sour cream, no diced tomato. It looks like a BBQ Pork Sandwich. No fries with it either, just the sandwich and the drink. Pull this article and rename it something else."
2002281544,60350,2018-09-22,1,"Totally gross. Followed to a T and ended up clumpy (I think too much flour.) I shredded my own cheese, so it couldn't have been because of that. Also, the flavor was bland."

2002281305,342426,2018-09-22,0,"Just made the batter. Hope it firms up enough to handle after refrigeration. I have been baking for years, I worked in my grandparents bakery from 14 t0 21 (Until I finished college. Mixture seems too creamy will refrigerate overnight if need be. Anybody have a problem forming cookies ?"
2002281837,447254,2018-09-22,5,Super easy to make with the timing of the pasta (boiling water then cooking) matching up almost perfectly with the timing of the chicken. Went great with a caesar salad.

2002279810,74010,2018-09-21,5,"I made this and it was fabulous. Made it for my family. And grandkids love it!! It was a little thick. So I used 1/2 cup butter. 1/2 cup Veg oil. And instead Of water I used just a little over a half cup of hot fresh coffee. I sprinkled with powder sugar, top with butter. And chocolate syrup. Or just the reg syrup. The kids call them mocha chocolate waffles."
2002279811,107786,2018-09-21,5,These ribs are amazing!! by far the best ribs I have ever made. Thank you so much for sharing
2002138612,360499,2018-09-21,0,"Made these today and the cupcakes turned out great. However, I messed up the frosting. 1/2 cup of butter with 4 cups of sugar turned out really crumbly so I had to add another 1/2 cup which turned out to a good consistency albeit too sweet. I would probably half the icing sugar next time."
2002280332,209986,2018-09-21,5,"I used Sara Lee wheat bread 2 slices 1 point, 1/4 cup egg beaters tiny bit of vanilla, 1/8 cup of fat free milk, sprinkle of cinnamon and olive oil spray sprinkled tiny bit of truvia after cooked and will have for breakfast in the morning. I did try a small piece and it tastes just like regular french toast to me. Made same for hubby minus truvia for breakfast in the morning. Even he is loving Weight Watchers recipes I try and he does not need to lose an ounce!"
2000927928,152116,2018-09-21,5,"I used some of the seasoning in the cavity of the bird and trussed it. Put it on the rotisserie on my gas grill set at 350-375 degrees with a disposable pan under the bird with chicken stock and butter in it. Temped at 1 hour, not done. Temped at 1-1/2 hrs and was perfect. Thighs were 175 and the breast was 165. This was amazing!!! Kinda hard to get excited about a rotisserie chicken but this recipe is a keeper. Oh yeah. I also used a smoker box with hickory pellets in it to give the bird a kiss of smoke."
2002280267,113861,2018-09-21,4,"I like to add a pinch or two of Cajun seasoning to the sauce, otherwise it can be a bit bland."
2000356355,440175,2018-09-21,5,"I make this ALL the time. Everyone loves it. I put it on mixed greens with paper thin red onion slices, crumbled goat cheese, sliced strawberries and some crumbled bacon. It's an awesome combination. Sometimes I'll add toasted pinenuts as well."
2002279317,58901,2018-09-21,5,I made this for my family just a few adjustments and it was a treat. I will definitely be making this again so simple and better than any can soup!!
667812,182382,2018-09-21,5,"I do mine the same way, but I add about 1/2 teaspoon of dried dill for more of a deli flavor"
2002280363,176796,2018-09-21,4,Made this babies today and had a green cupcake ?? i guess it will really help to achieve a true ube flavor by using/adding ube essence. But the cupcake turned out really fluffy and soft!
2000288349,349246,2018-09-21,4,"I quite like this version of mug cake, though your oven can be wildly different in timing. I do the reduction as recommended of 2 T flour and 2 Cocoa and Milk instead of water. I use a pyrex measuring cup for my mug. If it's undercooked it tends more to crumb as some have complained over, it needs to sort of &quot;steam&quot; I think. I ONLY ever use butter, not oil."
1804516,92095,2018-09-21,5,"I used ground venison, added 2 tsp Cumin powder, 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp ground sage. Garden style Ragu. It was Awesome!"

2002280862,535290,2018-09-21,0,What kind of sprinkles are the best to use if you have a geek in your family and want to make it just for them? I've looked around and couldn't find any sprinkles that were geeky enough. Thanks!
2002280538,356881,2018-09-21,3,"The brownie was grainy and it didn't cook entirely, it started to burn after ~60 seconds. It still tastes good, but its not the brownie texture I was hoping for."
2002280247,159894,2018-09-21,5,It's all gone. No time for a picture.
46065715,17186,2018-09-21,5,Excellent mac and cheese! Wish it was a little creamier but fantastic flavor.
2001776525,2886,2018-09-21,5,"You had me at, remove odd pots and pans from oven. Good solid recipe, very moist and delicious."
2002280182,530002,2018-09-21,5,Turned out like the picture!
2002280582,99476,2018-09-21,5,This was so good! Will definitely make it again.
1629751,67655,2018-09-21,5,"I've made this salad about four times. I really like it and my husband always raves about it. You must toast the pecans, and I highly recommend sticking with the pecans. They are an element that really makes this salad shine. The fat free dressing is great with it. Highly recommended."
2000794193,209590,2018-09-21,0,"Lemon prices are sky high and they are waxed here in Thailand since they are imported. Limes on the other hand are cheap and abundant. Will give this recipe a try with limes instead. Has anyone else tried this with limes, and was the &quot;in recipes&quot; taste totally different using preserved limes?"
489929,470044,2018-09-21,1,This is a good tasting Mac-N-Cheese but the texture is not the same as Noodle N Co. This recipe is to floury in flavour and texture. I'm looking for a creamy texture.
2001833519,70539,2018-09-21,5,"Great recipe, my mother in law used to make this in smaller quantity, we didn't can it, just serve it in a dish with home made bread for supper or dessert ."
2002280706,76756,2018-09-21,0,"This recipe is a bit confusing. The amount of oats to use is not listed, nor which amount of flour is to be used for which part (crumble or apple filling) If you're just mindlessly following the recipe it could get mixed up easily."
2002280490,125021,2018-09-21,5,Its perfect! A little spicy for me but still good!
2002280398,223683,2018-09-21,5,"I made this and loved it, although instead of vegetable oil I used olive oil and used strawberry balsamic also added blueberries it was delicious.... thank you for the recipe"
2001387699,278956,2018-09-21,5,"I use Worcestershire sauce quite a bit for roasts and soups, so I was happy to find a recipe to save a little money. Worcestershire sauce can be so pricey at the supermarket. From the moment the heat turned up, I knew it was going to be a great sauce. Another poster asked what's the reason for heating this up and I believe that when dry spices are heated, they release more flavor. This one is a keeper."
2002280237,261889,2018-09-21,5,I just finished a batch. I made it 1-1/2 times the recipe &amp; made 50 round 3.5” cookies. Since I’m not a fan of sweet cookies I found these to be delicious. I plan to ice them tomorrow with the attached icing recipe. I’ll attach a picture when they’re finished.
2001992595,532651,2018-09-21,1,"This recipe suffers from a serious lack of directions. It may a great dish, but these directions will definitely not get you there... how did this ever got onto the &quot;most popular&quot; list? Please fix, ASAP!"
2002280348,502353,2018-09-21,5,This bread is so delicious and was absolutely gorgeous when I pulled it out of the oven!
2002280886,170494,2018-09-21,5,"Make it as a main dish! Cook the squash (acorn or butternut) until crisp/tender. Allow to cool a bit. In meantime, saute 1/2 onion chopped &amp; 1 large garlic clove chopped for a few minutes. Add 1/4 to 1/2 lb good quality bulk sausage meat. Break up and cook until sausage is cooked through. Put the sausage mixture in a bowl, add 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 2 Tbsp maple syrup (or 1 Tbsp brown sugar &amp; 1 Tbsp honey), salt &amp; pepper to taste. Scrape out squash and add to bowl, leaving about 1/4&quot; on skins to help hold their shape. Mix everything together (an old fashioned potato masher works well), then fill the squash shells with the mix. Top with a little more cheese and cook for another 5 minutes in microwave (or preferably in a pre-heated convection oven @ 350 for 10 minutes or regular oven @ 375 for 15 minutes. YUMMY!"
2420043,114432,2018-09-21,5,"Delicious! Although I modified the recipe to utilize ingredients I had on hand, I followed the basics &amp; was delighted with the results. See the Tweaks section to read my adaptation."
2002280057,65340,2018-09-21,5,"These are the best rolls I've ever made. They were delicious and easy to make. I have a milk allergy, so I substituted almond milk, but they turned out great."
2002280508,34753,2018-09-21,5,"This is a great recipe ,especially for a beginner that's only been doing sourdough for a couple weeks, thank you so much! This made 3 nice size loaves, crispy on the top soft in the middle, kids ate it right up. I read an idea about doing a soft dusting of cornmeal on the bottom of the greased pans ,and I liked that tweak."
2002267534,234531,2018-09-21,5,The cook time for me in a gas oven was 5-7 minutes maximum. Otherwise the rest of the recipe is awesome.
1804691,339440,2018-09-21,5,"I must say that this as close to how I make it channeling my &quot;Down Maine&quot;, paternal grandmother's approach that includes using celery in it...a &quot;must&quot;! Having always had a prolific garden, at the end of every season, she canned quarts of what was called &quot;Garden Special&quot; which was meant to use up tomatoes, onions, green peppers and celery. She'd add a quart of this to a cast iron skillet of 1# + of browned ground beef to go with a cooked box of elbow macaroni to make the most delicious American Chop Suey!"
2000359632,69173,2018-09-21,4,I always soak bread in milk and add that to the meat mixture. I saute some minced onion and add that as well.
2002280304,33489,2018-09-21,5,The best coleslaw I've found. It's my go to side dish.
2002280831,69983,2018-09-21,5,The cake was great! I followed the exact recipe and I'm not sure I would change anything about it. I used a round 12 inch baking pan instead of the 9x13 pan. It had to cook another 20 minutes but it turned out perfectly. The whole family raved about it. Will definitely make it again.
2002279646,486243,2018-09-20,5,Omg.. I made this for Thanksgiving it was a big hit my sons girlfriend never liked banana pudding but she loved it.. I've been looking for recipe but Paula had others that wasn't it but I found it and I'm gonna make field Sunday dinner.. Sooooo good and simple..
2002279583,330734,2018-09-20,5,Made this today - followed the recipe and process with a small tweak - It turned out fantastic. Very moist and not dry at all. I tented it after 20 min. A keeper for sure!
2001854087,147494,2018-09-20,5,"This was a big hit with the family! I added fresh broccoli, mushrooms, and zucchini to the crock pot at the same time as I added the cream of chicken soup mixture and it turned out great!"
2002280013,60350,2018-09-20,4,Delish! Really need to whisk vigorously!
2002279815,173780,2018-09-20,5,This is by far the BEST tomato-free catsup recipe I've tried. Made it to use in a meatloaf due to my daughter's tomato sensitivity and it was the best meatloaf I've ever made. Can't wait to try it in my barbeque sauce!
2005904,229625,2018-09-20,5,"This was amazing. I added 1/4 of greek seasoning and cooked for 90 secs in microwave. After it rested for a bit, I split it and toasted it in the pan that I cooked my turkey burger in. It was so filling! I think I might split the recipe into two different portions next time because I was overstuffed!"
2002279877,271419,2018-09-20,5,Oh my! I can't believe this;I just made it.I tried it 4times before and my sugar got burnt.Thank you so much. Advice:Ensure you keep shaking the pot
2001080258,139133,2018-09-20,4,"I've made this recipe twice within a two week period. The flavor was very good for a lightened up stove top type rice pudding. I would certainly make it a third time, but would use the lessons I learned by making it twice already. Here are some observations/suggestions from my experience making this recipe: The first time I made it, I used freshly cooked hot Jasmine rice. The Jasmine rice gave the finished pudding a special lovely flavor, but the cooked Jasmine rice was a bit too soft. The rice seemed to thicken the pudding too fast and too much. After the pudding was refrigerated, the rice sort of lost its shape and dissolved into the pudding. The refrigerated pudding was not pudding-like, but more like a hard custard. The second time I made the recipe, I used cold refrigerated cooked rice which was rice that was not as cooked as the Jasmine rice I used the first time I made the recipe. This, along with not thickening the pudding during the cooking quite as much (cooked pudding mix fewer minutes and on lower heat than the recipe suggests) made for a perfect texture with rice that held up. Yes, I cooked the pudding on low simmer instead of medium heat. I cooked it until it was just barely pudding thickness both during the first cooking phase, and the second one with the remaining milk and egg. When I removed it from the heat at the end, it was like a slightly runny rice pudding, but as it cooled, it thickened. It was perfectly thick (to my taste) when it was still a little warm. After refrigerating, it was even slightly thicker, but still where I wanted it. My refrigerated pudding was thick enough that I could literally turn the bowl upside down and not have the pudding fall out. But when I dug into it with a spoon, it was fine. As said, the rice held up the second time. The rice I used the second time was a leftover rice from a Japanese restaurant. A plain type white rice."

2002280080,409527,2018-09-20,0,I can't find the cracked wheat anywhere. Bob's Red Mill used to make it. No more. Please recommend where to purchase. Thanks!
2089043,135272,2018-09-20,1,Seemed really slimy using flour and butter. Ended up washing the coating off fish and seasoning with lemon and butter. Keep it simple and broil with simple butter. Would not make again.
2002279876,2886,2018-09-20,5,BEST BANANA BREAD! Amazingly moist and the consistency fine. I cut the sugar down to half a cup and added pecans and chocolate chips.
1802936715,536843,2018-09-20,1,"Sorry to say, it was not good at all. It had no flavor and I followed the recipe exactly as stated. Wanted to like it as it is a simple meal, but did not work out for us."
2002279817,92095,2018-09-20,5,Love these meatballs!! I've tried many different recipes...this one got the family's vote. I now only make these...thanks for the recipe:))
2002191386,80156,2018-09-20,0,"They Didn't Turn Out As Planned... They were really, really strong!!! I Was Hoping For A Soft, Delicious Cookie But This Recipe Was Nothing Near That!"
2002279437,84475,2018-09-20,4,"Ok. This bread was great! My problem is when into the bake mood it collapsed In the middle. The flavor was incredible. I made grilled cheese sandwiches that were to die for. I do live in southwest Florida where it is very humid. What I did was I heated the water, added the salt, sugar, olive oil. Checked the temp. Then the rest of ingredients. During add-in cycle, I added extra pepperoni and extra cheese. Could this be the cause?"
2000820883,366301,2018-09-20,0,"I learned from another recipe that if extra height and fluffiness is something you want to achieve on a recipe, you beat your eggs until they're stiff before you fold them into the rest of the mix. Learned that with multiple batches of FLAT pancakes."
2002279920,252920,2018-09-20,0,"I love this recipe..BUT... I don't like pickling spice. So I omitted the pickling spice and added 1 1/2 TBS of ground garam masala instead, along with 1/2 of the turmeric. IT IS DELICIOUS and has the warmth of Indian flavors. Great on everything. I could eat it right out of the jar."
2000449069,227127,2018-09-20,5,I was very surprised at the wonderful taste. Only changes I made was to add 1-1/2 C of chicken broth and I forgot the ranch dressing. I used 1# of andouille sausage with 1# of kielbasa. I like the zip this added. I cooked this in an instant pot on high in the slow cooker mode. The potatoes took every bit of 8 hours to cook.
2002156055,290745,2018-09-20,5,"Just made this to use in one of my Grandmother's 'receipts'. She would be about 136 years old now...always cooked with a wood stove, Maine Mother of the Year in the 50's, farmer's wife, mother of 9 living and 14 including all she lost. Has now over 200 of us still living her legacy. I am lucky enough to have all of her recipes (known to all of us as her receipts) along with her diary (Yup my oldest brother at the age of 3 swallowed the clock key and passed it 3 days later). With all that said&gt;&gt;&gt; I was out of brown sugar using one of her recipes. I figured heck, she was not the type to buy it and even maybe back in her day there was no such packaged thing. I used this recipe as a substitution. I also did not put it through a processor (heck they were not invented in her day). I used a fork to mix it well! Her recipe came out great!...despite me having to figure out oven temps to her written instructions add 3 more logs in the fire."
2002279601,56694,2018-09-20,5,"Great recipe! Even my husband who swears he hates Salisbury steak, ( only food ive seen him not want to eat) not only liked this recipe, but went up for seconds. Not gonna lie i felt pretty proud of myself, Ha! So from me and my husband, thank you for sharing your recipe!"
2002279463,129926,2018-09-20,5,"LOVED IT. Though I am a person who likes to tweak. The only thing I did different was how I made the chicken. I boiled my chicken and as it was boiling I chopped the onion up. Once the chicken was done I shredded it. In a pan I put the onions, extra chilies, Rotel, and cumin let them cook for a little bit then I added the chicken, picante sauce, and some more cumin. Then I just mixed it together and followed the rest of the instructions."
2001784533,194823,2018-09-20,5,"Omg yum. I couldn't cook this exactly as stated bc I didn't have all the ingredients and didn't feel like going to the store. I used a smoked gouda and pizza blend in place of fontina, cilantro instead of parsley, and more sour cream in place if cream cheese. Hell I didnt even have regular sharp cheddar and just shredded white cheddar cheese slices I had sitting in the fridge. I even omitted tomatoes bc I didn't have any. Still phenomonal. I can't wait to cook them according to the actual recipe next time."
2000450553,312075,2018-09-20,0,"Omg, you don't need 40 minutes to cook 6 eggs, and the other ingredients!"
2002280120,440974,2018-09-20,5,"So easy and delicious! If you find you have too many lemons - try this recipe. One suggestion - my lemons were too cold from being the frig, so after packing the jars and liquid and adding the hot lids &amp; rings, They got a hot water bath for about 6 minutes. This ensured the lids would pop down and seal."
2002279496,389287,2018-09-20,5,Made these with stewed rhubarb instead of applesauce and they are so good!
2001773389,299974,2018-09-20,5,"My wife and I both loved this marinade! We don't have a grill, so we used a cast-iron skillet to sear and broil."
2002279511,27208,2018-09-20,5,Amazing! Made exactly as directed. Not too salty for our taste. Would definitely make again!
2462845,217910,2018-09-20,5,I use this recipe all the time. It makes the most tender chicken. I use it for kabobs or I keep the marinade and use it for chicken stir fry after I boil the marinade (min. 3 minutes). This is a keeper!
315055,217910,2018-09-20,5,"Absolutely amazing, one of my favorite meals ever!"
2002280153,330734,2018-09-20,5,Voila! this is the only recipe with higher cooking temps that gives me juicy bird and brown crispy skin every time. Seasonings are a personal choice and I always try unique flavours-but any recipes calling for cooking at 350 for an hour require I hit bird with the broiler just to get some colour. No need to look elsewhere
2002280135,272437,2018-09-20,5,Also... serve with fresh cut veggies and/or pieces of fresh bread!
2000498330,460410,2018-09-20,5,I am completely unfamiliar with Alabama anything. But this Coney Dog is fabulous. The chili has a sweetish tangy flavor that definitely hit with me. Gladly will make this again and again.
2002279829,509504,2018-09-20,5,"I live at 9000 ft. On my initial attempt, I tried this recipe exactly as written. Cookies turned out OK, but pretty flat and hard the following day. On my 2nd attempt I followed the recipe, but modified it by simply adding 1 additional Tablespoon of flour (for a total of 3/4 cup flour + 3 Tablespoons). These cookies turned out fabulous! They had great volume and stayed soft and chewy for days. This is a terrific recipe! I hope this helps folks living at higher altitudes."
2000116397,209118,2018-09-20,0,"Arrange the rolls on the bed of sauerkraut in the pot. Place the smoked pork slices on top of the rolls and spread the remaining 1 cup of sauerkraut over all. Pour in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock; it should cover the cabbage rolls. If not, add more stock. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Serve paprika gravy on the side."
1760586,438883,2018-09-20,5,"BEST Soup Recipe EVER!!! I've always loved Panera's version, but I do believe this is even better! Everyone in the family loved it &amp; is already requesting it again."
2002279220,36784,2018-09-20,4,"This was a great recipe. Used rotini for noodles because I couldn't find rice or egg noodles and yogurt instead of sour cream, and it worked fine. Also used Gulden's Spicy Brown Mustard instead of dried mustard. Siblings loved it, even though my sister was wary at first because she thought yogurt and mustard sounded disgusting together, but she loved it eventually."
2002279495,82945,2018-09-20,5,"Amazing cookies, they turn out perfect every time. I chill them for about 10 minutes before baking and the shape of the cookie stays exact. Use 2.5 cups of flour and 1/4 cocoa powder to make a chocolate version."
1429485,216577,2018-09-20,5,My family loved this. I made it with chicken thighs since that is what I had. I served it over spaghetti. We took the leftovers for lunch the next day. My son said it was one of the best lunches he'd had.
2001773389,383078,2018-09-20,5,Now my wife's favorite recipe! Thanks so much!
2002279938,82945,2018-09-20,0,Made these for the first time and a add-on for the desserts at my daughters birthday. I added sprinkles to the dough instead of full on decorating. They were super simple and delicious! Will be making again!!
2002279783,67256,2018-09-20,5,This has an old secret i learned from a wedding cake baker. Put your cake right from oven to freezer for 45 min to stop all the moisture evaporating as it cools!! Try it i swear by it on all cakes.
2177426,34478,2018-09-20,5,"Excellent recipe! Thank you. I've made it several times so now, of course, I fool around with it. Added greens and cream cheese but didn't have the mushrooms. Still wonderful!"
305531,158151,2018-09-20,5,Yum. I used this as a dip for potstickers and it was a real hit. Thanks for sharing.
43683980,320572,2018-09-20,3,"This turned out reasonably well, but would benefit from several tweaks to increase flavour. As written, it's a confusing recipe between the ingredients list, and the errors in the method... I'll try to make some edits."
